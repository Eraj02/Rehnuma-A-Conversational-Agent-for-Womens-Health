introduction  ﬁnd everything you need to know in this book   Having a baby is one of the most exciting things that  can happen to you. But you might be feeling nervous   as well. If it’s your ﬁrst baby, it’s hard to know what   to expect.  Your mum, colleagues, friends and relations might all   be giving you advice. And then there is all the information   on the internet as well as in magazines and books. At times  it can feel overwhelming and it’s hard to know who is   right when people say different things.   This book brings together everything you need to know  to have a healthy and happy pregnancy, and to make sure  you get the care that is right for you. The guidance about  pregnancy and babies does change.  So it’s important to get   up-to-date, trusted advice   so that you can make   the right decisions   and choices.   If you have any   questions or concerns   – no matter how trivial   they may seem – talk to  your midwife or doctor.   They are there to   support you.

This  applies to men too. You are more  likely to get pregnant if you are  both in good health.  –  If you smoke, get advice  about stopping. You can   talk to your doctor, visit   www.nhs.uk/smokefree or   call the free NHS smoking  helpline on 0800 022 4 332.  –  Eat a balanced diet.  –  Maintain a healthy weight.  –  You should avoid drinking   • Take 400 micrograms of folic   alcohol if you are pregnant or  trying to conceive. If you do  choose to drink, then protect  your baby by drinking no more  than one to two units of alcohol  once or twice a week and don’t  get drunk (see page 32).  –  Take exercise.   • If you or your partner take   any medication, talk to your  doctor about whether it will   affect your pregnancy.  acid a day. You should continue   to take this until you are 12   weeks pregnant (see page 27).  • If you have a health condition,  for example mental health  problems, diabetes or a   family history of any   inherited diseases,    talk to your GP   or a specialist   before you try   to get pregnant.  •  Talk to your   GP or a   healthcare  professional  if you have  any concerns  or need  support.  5  0–8 WEEKS  8–12 WEEKS   •  You can take a pregnancy  test from the ﬁrst day that  you miss your period (see  Finding out that you are  pregnant on page 16).  •  As soon as you know you  are pregnant, get in touch  with a midwife or your GP  to organise your antenatal  care (see Finding out that  you are pregnant on page  16 and Antenatal care on  page 40). Begin to think  about where you want  your baby to be born (see  Choosing where to have  your baby on page 70).   •  Some pregnant women   start to feel sick or tired or  have other minor physical  problems for a few weeks  (see Common minor  problems on page 58).  • Take 10 micrograms of   vitamin D per day, which  is in Healthy Start vitamin  supplements or other  supplements recommended  by your midwife. You  should continue to take  vitamin D throughout your  pregnancy and while you  are breastfeeding.   >  >  •  You will usually attend your   •  You will usually be offered   •  Make a dental appointment.   ﬁrst appointment by 10  weeks and your booking  appointment by 12 weeks.   •  At the booking appointment,   your weight, height and  body mass index will be  measured.

E L A M  1  2  5  3  4  6  7  parts of the body  10  MALE SEX ORGANS 1 2  Bladder Vas deferens  The two tubes called the vas deferens  carry sperm from the testes (testicles), where sperm are   made, to the prostate and other glands. These glands add  secretions that are ejaculated along with the sperm.  3  4  5  6  Urethra  The urethra is a tube running down the length  of the penis from the bladder, through the prostate gland,   to an opening at the tip of the penis. Sperm travel down   the urethra to be ejaculated.  Penis  The penis is made of erectile tissue, which acts like  a sponge. When it becomes ﬁlled with blood, the penis  becomes hard and erect.  Prostate gland  This is a gland at the base of the penis.  Scrotum  The testes are contained in a bag of skin called  the scrotum, which hangs outside the body. The scrotum  helps to keep the testes at a constant temperature, just   below body temperature. This is necessary for sperm to   be produced. When it is warm, the scrotum hangs down  away from the body to keep the testes cool. When it is cold,  the scrotum draws up closer to the body for warmth.  7  Testes  Men have two testes, which are glands where  sperm are made and stored.

It is made   of muscle and increases in size as the baby grows.  3 Fallopian tubes  The fallopian tubes lead from  the ovaries to the uterus. Eggs are released from   the ovaries into the fallopian tubes each month.   This is where fertilisation takes place.  4 Ovaries  There are two ovaries, each about the   size of a walnut. They produce the eggs or ova.  5 Cervix  The cervix is the neck of the uterus. It is  normally almost closed, with just a small opening  through which blood passes during monthly   periods. During labour, the cervix will dilate to   let the baby move from the uterus into the vagina.  6 Vagina  Most babies are born through the vagina,   which is a tube about 8cm (3 inches) long. It leads  from the cervix down to the vulva, where it opens  between the legs. The vagina is very elastic, so it   can easily stretch around a man’s penis during sex   or around a baby during labour.  11  The female monthly cycle 2 1  B  A  E  3  D  C  Egg being released Fallopian tube Vagina Ovary  A B C D Ovulation occurs each month when  an egg (ovum) is released from  one of the ovaries. Occasionally,  more than one egg is released,  usually within 24 hours of the ﬁrst  egg. The ‘ﬁngers’ at the end of the  fallopian tubes help to direct the egg  down into the tube. At the same  time, the lining of the uterus begins  to thicken and the mucus in the  cervix becomes thinner so that sperm  can swim through it more easily.  E Egg progressing down the   F Uterus lining being shed  fallopian tube     F  The egg begins to travel down   the fallopian tube. If a man and  woman have recently had sex, the  egg might be fertilised here by   the man’s sperm. The lining of the  uterus is now thick enough for   the fertilised egg to be implanted.  If the egg is not fertilised, it will pass  out of the body during the woman’s  monthly period along with the lining  of the uterus, which is also shed.  The egg is so small that it cannot   be seen.   Conception  Conception is the process that begins with the fertilisation of an egg and ends with the implantation   of an egg into a woman’s uterus. 1  2  3  F  A  D  B  C  E  A B C  Egg Sperm being ejaculated Penis  Ovulation A woman conceives around the  time when she is ovulating; that  is, when an egg has been released  from one of her ovaries into one   of her fallopian tubes.    D E  Egg being fertilised Sperm   F  Attached embryo   Fertilisation During sex, sperm are ejaculated from  a man’s penis into a woman’s vagina.  In one ejaculation there may be more  than 300 million sperm. Most of the  sperm leak out of the vagina but  some begin to swim up through the  cervix. When a woman is ovulating,  the mucus in the cervix is thinner  than usual to let sperm pass through  more easily. Sperm swim into the  uterus and into the fallopian tubes.  Fertilisation takes place if a sperm  joins with an egg and fertilises it.  Implantation During the week after fertilisation,  the fertilised egg (which is now an  embryo) moves slowly down the  fallopian tube and into the uterus.  It is already growing. The embryo  attaches itself ﬁrmly to the specially  thickened uterus lining. This is called  implantation. Hormones released  by the embryonic tissue prevent the  uterus lining from being shed. This  is why women miss their periods  when they are pregnant.  12  Sperm is about 1/25th of a millimetre long and has a head, neck and tail.   The tail moves from side to side so that the sperm can swim up the vagina  into the uterus and fallopian tubes.  One egg or ovum (occasionally two or more) is released from the   woman’s ovaries every month. It moves down into the fallopian tube   where it may be fertilised by a man’s sperm.  1  I  B E C O M N G P R E G N A N T     HORMONES  Both men and women have  hormones, which are chemicals that  circulate in the bloodstream. They  carry messages to different parts  of the body and result in certain  changes taking place. Female  hormones, which include oestrogen  and progesterone, control many of  the events of a woman’s monthly  cycle, such as the release of eggs  from her ovaries and the thickening  of her uterus lining.  During pregnancy, your hormone  levels change. As soon as you  have conceived, the amount of  oestrogen and progesterone in your  blood increases. This causes the  uterus lining to build up, the blood  supply to your uterus and breasts  to increase and the muscles of your  uterus to relax to make room for   the growing baby.  The increase in hormone levels  can affect how you feel. You may  have mood swings, feel tearful or  be easily irritated. For a while you  may feel that you cannot control  your emotions, but these symptoms  should ease after the ﬁrst three  months of your pregnancy.  the mother’s egg is always the same  and is known as the X chromosome.   But the sex chromosome from   the father’s sperm can be an X or   a Y chromosome.   If the egg is fertilised by a sperm  containing an X chromosome,   the baby will be a girl (XX). If the  sperm contains a Y chromosome,  the baby will be a boy (XY).  BOY OR GIRL? Every normal human cell contains  46 chromosomes, except for male  sperm and female eggs. These  contain 23 chromosomes each.  When a sperm fertilises an egg, the  23 chromosomes from the father  pair with the 23 from the mother,  making 46 in all.   Chromosomes are tiny, thread-like  structures which each carry about  2,000 genes. Genes determine  a baby’s inherited  characteristics, such as  hair and eye colour,  blood group, height  and build. A fertilised  egg contains one sex  chromosome from  its mother and one  from its father. The  sex chromosome from   13  This chart shows a 28-day cycle. Yours may be longer or shorter.

It is usually possible to ﬁnd out  through your dating ultrasound  scan, which happens between eight  and 14 weeks (see page 48).   You should be told at this point  whether the babies share a placenta  (are identical) or if they have two  separate placentas, in which case  they can be either identical or  non-identical. If this cannot be  determined, you should be offered  a further scan. A third of identical  twins have two separate placentas.  This happens when the fertilised  egg splits in the ﬁrst 3–4 days after  conception and before it implants   in the uterus.   TWINS, TRIPLETS  OR MORE Identical twins occur when one  fertilised egg splits into two; each  baby will have the same genes   – and therefore they will be the   same sex and look very alike.   Non-identical twins are more  common. They are the result of   two eggs being fertilised by two  sperm at the same time. The babies  may be of the same sex or different  sexes, and will probably look no  more alike than any other brothers  and sisters. A third of all twins   will be identical and two-thirds   non-identical.   Twins happen in about 1 in every   65 pregnancies. A couple is more  likely to have twins if there are   twins in the woman’s family.   Triplets occur naturally in 1 in  10,000 pregnancies and quads  are even rarer. Nowadays, the use  of drugs in the treatment of  infertility has made multiple  births more common.  Are you carrying  twins? You might suspect that you  are carrying more than  one baby if:  • you are very sick in   early pregnancy  THE BEST TIME TO  GET PREGNANT You are most likely to get pregnant  if you have sex within a day or so of  ovulation (see chart). This is usually  about 14 days after the ﬁrst day of  your last period.   An egg lives for about 12–24 hours  after it is released. For you to get  pregnant, the egg must be fertilised  by a sperm within this time. Sperm  can live for up to seven days inside  a woman’s body. So if you have  had sex in the seven days before  ovulation, the sperm will have   had time to travel up the fallopian  tubes to ‘wait’ for the egg to   be released.   14  1  I  B E C O M N G P R E G N A N T     PREGNANCY TESTS Pregnancy tests can be carried  out on a sample of urine from the  ﬁrst day of a missed period, which  means that, if you are pregnant,  you are about two weeks after  conception. Some very sensitive  tests can be used even before you  miss a period.  You can collect urine at any time  of the day. Use a clean, soap-free,  well-rinsed container to collect it.  You can get pregnancy tests free  of charge from your GP or family  planning clinic. Pregnancy tests are  also available at NHS walk-in centres.   Many pharmacists and most  pregnancy advisory services also   offer tests, usually for a small  fee. You can buy do-it-yourself  pregnancy testing kits from  pharmacists. They can give you   a quick result and you can do   the test in private. There are a   range of tests that are available.  How they work varies, so check   the instructions. Results of the test A positive test result is almost  certainly correct. A negative result is  less reliable. If you still think you are  pregnant, wait a week and try again  or go and see a midwife or GP.  What is different about  being pregnant with  twins or more? All multiple pregnancies have   a higher risk of complications   – particularly premature birth.   If your babies share a placenta  (identical twins) it is recommended  that you are scanned every two  weeks from 16 weeks onwards,  and every four weeks if your babies  have separate placentas. You may  be advised to have a caesarean  section. You should discuss this  with your doctor, but it is your  choice. It is possible to breastfeed  twins and triplets and there is more  information about how you can do  this in Chapter 9. You may ﬁnd that  a combination of breast and formula  feeding is best for you – particularly  if you have triplets or more.  Help and support  You might ﬁnd it helpful to  contact support groups like  Tamba (Twins and Multiple  Births Association) and the  Multiple Births Foundation  (see pages 188 and 183) before  your babies are born.  THE SIGNS OF  PREGNANCY For women who have a regular  monthly cycle, the earliest and   most reliable sign of pregnancy   is a missed period. Sometimes  women who are pregnant have a  very light period, losing only a little  blood. Other signs of pregnancy   are as follows:  • Feeling sick – you may feel sick,   or even be sick. This is commonly  known as ‘morning sickness’ but  it can happen at any time of the  day. If you are being sick all the  time and cannot keep anything  down, contact your GP.  • Changes in your breasts – your  breasts may become larger and  feel tender, like they might do  before your period. They may also  tingle.

See your midwife or doctor as soon as possible if you are   currently being treated for a long-term disease such   as diabetes or epilepsy, or you have serious mental   health problems.   15  FINDING OUT  THAT YOU ARE  PREGNANT When you ﬁnd out that you are  pregnant, you may feel happy and  excited or even shocked, confused  and upset. Everybody is different  and you should not worry if you are  not feeling as happy as you might  have expected. Even if you have  been trying to get pregnant, your  feelings may take you by surprise.  Some of these feelings may be  caused by changes in your   hormone levels, which can   make you feel more emotional.  Even if you feel anxious and  uncertain now, your feelings may  change. Talk to your midwife, GP   or family planning clinic, who will  try to help you to adjust or will give  you advice if you don’t want to  continue with your pregnancy.   Men may also have mixed feelings  when they ﬁnd out that their  partner is pregnant. They may   ﬁnd it hard to talk about these  feelings because they don’t want   to upset their partner. Both partners  should encourage each other to  talk about their feelings and any  worries or concerns that they have  at this stage.  However you are feeling, you  should contact an NHS professional  (see Chapter 4) so that you can start  to receive antenatal care. This is the  care that you will receive leading up  to the birth of your baby.  Telling people You may want to tell your family  and friends immediately or wait  a while until you have sorted out  how you feel. Many women wait  until they have had their ﬁrst scan  before they tell people that they   are pregnant.   Members of your family/extended  family may have mixed feelings or  react in unexpected ways to your  news. You may wish to discuss this  with your midwife.   ACCESSING  ANTENATAL CARE When you ﬁnd out that you   are pregnant, it’s important to   contact an NHS professional   as soon as possible.   You can book an appointment  directly with a midwife. Your GP  surgery will be able to put you   in touch with your nearest   midwife service.  If you have special health needs,  your midwife, GP or other doctors  may take shared responsibility for  your maternity care.  Your ﬁrst or second meeting  with your midwife is the booking  appointment. This will last for up to  two hours and could take place at   a hospital, in a clinic or a Children’s  Centre, in a GP surgery or at home.  Your midwife will ask you many  questions about your health, the  health of your family and your  preferences in order to develop your  own plan of care. Your midwife  will order a number of blood tests  and scans, which will be done  throughout your pregnancy. The  results of these tests may affect your  choices later in pregnancy, so it’s  important not to miss them. Your  midwife will also ask about any other  help or social care support you may  have or need – for example support  from social workers or family liaison  ofﬁcers. For more information about  the booking appointment, see   pages 42 and 44–45.  your feelings  16  HELP FOR   YOUNG MUMS If you are a young mum, there are  a wide range of services to support  you when you are pregnant and  after you have had your baby.

Week 3  1  2  3  4  5  Ovary  Egg is released from  the ovary  Egg is fertilised  Fertilised egg divides  and travels down  fallopian tube  Embryo implants  itself in uterus lining  MEASURING YOUR PREGNANCY Doctors and midwives in the UK  measure the duration of pregnancy  from the ﬁrst day of your last  menstrual period, not from the  day you conceive. So when you  are ‘four weeks pregnant’, it is  actually about two weeks after  you conceived. Pregnancy normally  lasts for 37–42 weeks from the  ﬁrst day of your last period.   The average is 40 weeks.    If you are not sure about the date  of your last period, then your early  scan (see page 48) will give a   good indication of when your   baby will be due.   In the very early weeks, the  developing baby is called an  embryo. From about eight weeks,  it is called a fetus.  4  3  2  1  5  18  Already your baby’s nervous system  is starting to develop. A groove  forms in the top layer of cells. The  cells fold up and round to make a  hollow tube called the neural tube.  This will become your baby’s brain  and spinal cord, so the tube has a  ‘head end’ and a ‘tail end’. Defects  in this tube are the cause of spina  biﬁda (see page 49). The heart is   also forming and your baby already  has some blood vessels. A string of  these blood vessels connects your  baby to you – this will become the  umbilical cord.  WEEKS 6–7 There is now a large bulge where  your baby’s heart is and a bump  for the head because the brain is  developing. The heart begins to  beat and can be seen beating on an  ultrasound scan. Dimples on the side  of the head will become the ears  and there are thickenings where the  eyes will be. On the body, bumps are  forming that will become muscles  and bones. And small swellings  (called ‘limb buds’) show where the  arms and legs are growing. At seven  weeks, the embryo has grown to  about 10mm long from head to  bottom. This measurement is called  the ‘crown–rump length’.  Week 7   The actual size from head   to bottom is about 10mm  WEEKS 8–9 Your baby’s face is slowly forming.  The eyes are more obvious and  have some colour in them. The  fetus has a mouth with a tongue.  There are the beginnings of hands  and feet, with ridges where the  ﬁngers and toes will be. The major  internal organs – the heart, brain,  lungs, kidneys, liver and gut – are all  developing. At nine weeks, the baby  has grown to about 22mm long  from head to bottom.  Week 6   Week 9   The actual size from head   to bottom is about 8mm  The actual size from head   to bottom is about 22mm  WEEK 3 This is three weeks from the ﬁrst  day of your last period. The   fertilised egg moves slowly along  your fallopian tube towards your  uterus. It begins as one single cell,  which divides again and again.   By the time the fertilised egg  reaches your uterus, it has become  a mass of over 100 cells, called an  embryo. It is still growing. Once in  your uterus, the embryo attaches  itself into your uterus lining.   This is called implantation.  WEEKS 4–5  Week 4  The actual size of the embryo   is about 5mm  The embryo now settles into your  uterus lining. The outer cells reach  out like roots to link with your  blood supply. The inner cells form  two – and then later three – layers.  Each of these layers will grow to be  different parts of your baby’s body.  One layer becomes their brain and  nervous system, skin, eyes and ears.  Another layer becomes their lungs,  stomach and gut. The third layer  becomes their heart, blood, muscles  and bones.   The ﬁfth week is when you will  miss your period. At this time, most  women are only just beginning to  think they may be pregnant.   2     H O W Y O U R        B A B Y D E V E L O P S  19  2  1  The umbilical cord   2  3  The umbilical cord is a baby’s lifeline. It is the link between you   and your baby. Blood circulates through the cord, carrying oxygen  and food to the baby and carrying waste away again. The placenta   The placenta is attached to the lining of the uterus and separates  your baby’s circulation from your circulation. In the placenta, oxygen  and food from your bloodstream pass into your baby’s bloodstream  and are carried to your baby along the umbilical cord. Antibodies  that give resistance to infection pass to your baby in the same way.  Alcohol, nicotine and other drugs can also pass to your baby this way. The amniotic sac  Inside the uterus, the baby ﬂoats in a bag of ﬂuid called the amniotic  sac. Before or during labour the sac, or ‘membranes’, break and the  ﬂuid drains out. This is known as the ‘waters breaking’.  1  3  Week 14   The actual size from head   to bottom is about 85mm  WEEKS 10–14 Just 12 weeks after conception, the  fetus is fully formed. Your baby has  all of their organs, muscles, limbs  and bones, and their sex organs are  developed. From now on your baby  will grow and mature. Your baby  is already moving about, but you  will not be able to feel movements  yet. By about 14 weeks, your baby’s  heartbeat is strong and can be  heard by an ultrasound scanner.   The heartbeat is very fast – about  twice as fast as a normal adult’s  heartbeat. At 14 weeks, the baby  is about 85mm long from head to  bottom. Your pregnancy may start  to show, but this varies a lot from  woman to woman.  20  WEEKS 15–22 Your baby is growing faster than  at any other time in their life.  Their body grows bigger so that  their head and body are more in  proportion, and they don’t look  so ‘top heavy’. The face becomes  much more deﬁned and the  hair, eyebrows and eyelashes are  beginning to grow. Their eyelids stay  closed over their eyes. Your baby  already has their own individual  ﬁngerprints, as the lines on the skin  of their ﬁngers are now formed.  Their ﬁngernails and toenails are  growing and their hands can grip.   At about 22 weeks, your baby  becomes covered in a very ﬁne,   soft hair called lanugo. We don’t  know what this hair is for, but it   is thought that it may keep the   baby at the right temperature.   The lanugo disappears before   birth or soon after.  Between 16 and 22 weeks, you  will usually feel your baby move for  the ﬁrst time. If this is your second  baby, you may feel it earlier – at  about 16–18 weeks. At ﬁrst, you  feel a ﬂuttering or bubbling, or a  very slight shifting movement. This  can feel a bit like indigestion. Later,  you will be able to tell that it is the  baby’s movements and you may  even see the baby kicking about.  Sometimes you will see a bump   that is clearly a hand or a foot.   Week 22   The actual size from head   to bottom is about 27cm  2     H O W Y O U R        B A B Y D E V E L O P S  21  Your baby is now covered in a  white, greasy substance called  vernix. It is thought that this may  be to protect its skin as it ﬂoats in  the amniotic ﬂuid. The vernix mostly  disappears before the birth.  From 24 weeks, your baby has a  chance of survival if it is born. Most  babies born before this time cannot  live because their lungs and other  vital organs are not developed well  enough. The care that can now  be given in neonatal units means  that more and more babies born  this early do survive. Babies born  at around this time have increased  risks of disability.  WEEKS 23–30 Your baby is now moving about  vigorously, and responds to touch  and sound. A very loud noise close  by may make them jump and kick.  They are also swallowing small  amounts of the amniotic ﬂuid in  which they are ﬂoating, and are  passing tiny amounts of urine back  into the ﬂuid. Sometimes your baby  may get hiccups, and you can feel  the jerk of each hiccup. Your baby  may also begin to follow a pattern  for waking and sleeping. Very often  this is a different pattern from   yours. So when you go to bed at  night, your baby may wake up and  start kicking.   Your baby’s heartbeat can be heard  through a stethoscope. Later,  your partner may be able to hear  the heartbeat by putting their ear  to your abdomen, but it can be  difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right place.   Week 30   The actual size from head to bottom   is about 33cm  22  At around 26 weeks your baby’s eyelids open for the   ﬁrst time. Babies’ eyes are almost always blue or dark blue,  although some babies do have brown eyes at birth.   It is not until some weeks after they are born that your   baby’s eyes will become the colour that they will stay.   The head-to-bottom length at 30 weeks is about 33cm.  WEEKS 31– 40 Your baby continues to grow. Their skin, which was quite  wrinkled before, becomes smoother, and both the vernix   and the lanugo begin to disappear.  By about 32 weeks, the baby is usually lying with   its head pointing downwards, ready for birth.   The baby’s head can ‘engage’, or move down   into the pelvis, before birth. Sometimes the   head doesn’t engage until labour has started.  bonding with your  2     H O W Y O U R        B A B Y D E V E L O P S  23 23  Helpful tips  Regularly talking, reading  and singing to your bump  while you are pregnant will  help you to bond with your  baby before birth.

This chapter explains some of the things you can   do to stay healthy.  WHAT SHOULD YOU EAT? A healthy diet is very important if  you are pregnant or trying to get  pregnant. Eating healthily during  pregnancy will help your baby to  develop and grow and will help to  keep you ﬁt and well. You don’t need  to go on a special diet, but make  sure that you eat a variety of different  foods every day in order to get the  right balance of nutrients that you  and your baby need. You should also  avoid certain foods – see ‘Foods to  avoid’ on page 26.  You will probably ﬁnd that you are  more hungry than normal, but you  don’t need to ‘eat for two’ – even if  you are expecting twins or triplets.  Have breakfast every day – this will  help you to avoid snacking on foods  that are high in fat and sugar. You  may have to change the amounts of  different foods that you eat, rather  than cutting out all your favourites.   More information  Visit www.eatwell.gov.uk  for useful information on what  you should eat when you are  pregnant or trying for a baby.  The leaﬂets Eating while you  are pregnant and Thinking  of having a baby? are also  available in several languages.  Both leaﬂets are available  online at www.food.gov.uk   or can be ordered on   0845 606 0667.     nutritious delicious  and  24  The eatwell plate  The ‘eatwell plate’ below shows how  much of each type of food you need to  have a healthy and well balanced diet.   Bread, rice, potatoes,    pasta and other   starchy foods  Carbohydrates are  satisfying without  containing too many  calories, and are an  important source of  vitamins and ﬁbre.  They include bread,  potatoes, breakfast  cereals, pasta, rice,   oats, noodles, maize,  millet, yams, cornmeal  and sweet potatoes.  These foods should   be the main part  of every meal. Eat  wholegrain varieties   when you can.  Milk and dairy foods Dairy foods like milk, cheese,  yoghurt and fromage frais  are important because they  contain calcium and other  nutrients that your baby  needs. Eat two or three  portions a day, using low-fat  varieties whenever you can   – for example, semi-skimmed   or skimmed milk, low-fat  yoghurt and half-fat hard  cheese. However, there are  some cheeses that you   should avoid – see ‘Foods   to avoid’ on page 26 for more  information.   Fruit and vegetables As well as vitamins and   minerals, fruit and vegetables  provide ﬁbre, which  helps digestion and  prevents constipation.  Eat at least ﬁve  portions of fresh,  frozen, canned,  dried or juiced fruit  and vegetables  each day. Always  wash them  carefully. To get  the most out  of vegetables,  eat them raw  or lightly cooked. For more  information and portion sizes,  visit www.5aday.nhs.uk   Meat, ﬁsh, eggs,  beans and other   non-dairy sources   of protein Protein includes meat (except  liver), ﬁsh, poultry, eggs,  beans, pulses and nuts (for  information on peanuts see  page 112). These foods are all  good sources of nutrients.   Eat moderate amounts each  day. Choose lean meat,  remove the skin from poultry  and cook using only a little   fat. Make sure eggs, poultry,  pork, burgers and sausages  are cooked all the way through.   Check that there is no pink  meat and that juices have no  pink or red in them. Try to eat  two portions of ﬁsh a week,  one of which should be oily  ﬁsh. There are some ﬁsh that  you should avoid – see ‘Foods  to avoid’ on page 26 for more  information.     Foods and drinks   that are high in   fat and/or sugar This food group includes all  spreading fats, oils, salad  dressings, cream, chocolate,  crisps, biscuits, pastries, ice  cream, cake, puddings and   ﬁzzy drinks. You should only   eat a small amount of these  foods. Sugar contains calories  without providing any other  nutrients that the body needs.  Having sugary foods and drinks  too often can cause tooth decay,  especially if you have them  between meals. If we eat more  than we need, this can lead to  weight gain. Eating more fatty  foods is likely to make you put  on weight. Having too much  saturated fat can increase the  amount of cholesterol in the  blood, which increases the  chance of developing heart  disease. Try to cut down on  food that is high in saturated  fat and have foods rich in  unsaturated fat instead.  3     Y O U R H E A L T H    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  25  FOODS TO AVOID There are some foods that you  should not eat when you are  pregnant because they may   make you ill or harm your baby.   You should avoid:  • Some types of cheese. Don’t  eat mould-ripened soft cheese,  like Brie, Camembert and others  with a similar rind. You should  also avoid soft blue-veined cheese,  like Danish blue. These are made  with mould and they can contain  listeria, a type of bacteria that can  harm your unborn baby. Although  listeriosis is a very rare infection,  it is important to take special  precautions during pregnancy  because even the mild form of  the illness in the mother can lead  to miscarriage, stillbirth or severe  illness in a newborn baby. You can  eat hard cheeses such as cheddar  and parmesan, and processed  cheeses made from pasteurised  milk such as cottage cheese,  mozzarella and cheese spreads.   • Pâté. Avoid all types of pâté,  including vegetable pâtés, as   they can contain listeria.  PREPARING FOOD • Wash fruit, vegetables and salads  to remove all traces of soil, which  may contain toxoplasma. This can  cause toxoplasmosis, which can  harm your baby (see page 37). • Heat ready-meals until they are  piping hot all the way through.  This is especially important for  meals containing poultry.  • Keep leftovers covered in the   fridge and use within two days. • Wash all surfaces and utensils,   and your hands, after preparing  raw meat. This will help to avoid  infection with toxoplasma.  • Raw or partially cooked eggs.  Make sure that eggs are thoroughly   cooked until the whites and yolks  are solid. This prevents the risk  of salmonella food poisoning.  Avoid foods that contain raw and  undercooked eggs, such as home- made mayonnaise.  • Raw or undercooked meat.   Cook all meat and poultry  thoroughly so that there is no  trace of pink or blood. Take  particular care with sausages and   minced meat. It is ﬁne to eat steaks   and other whole cuts of beef and  lamb rare, as long as the outside  has been properly cooked or sealed. • Liver products. Don’t eat liver, or  liver products like liver pâté or liver  sausage, as they may contain a lot  of vitamin A. Too much vitamin A  can harm your baby.   • Supplements containing  vitamin A. Don’t take high- dose multivitamin supplements,  ﬁsh liver oil supplements or any  supplements containing vitamin A.  • Some types of ﬁsh. Don’t eat   shark, marlin and swordﬁsh, and  limit the amount of tuna you eat  to no more than two tuna steaks  a week (about 140g cooked or  170g raw each) or four medium- sized cans of tuna a week (about  140g when drained). These types  of ﬁsh contain high levels of  mercury, which can damage   your baby’s developing nervous  system. Don’t eat more than two  portions of oily ﬁsh per week.   Oily ﬁsh includes fresh tuna  (but not canned tuna), salmon,  mackerel, sardines and trout.  • Raw shellﬁsh. Eat cooked rather   than raw shellﬁsh as they can  contain harmful bacteria and viruses  that can cause food poisoning.  • Peanuts. If you would like to   eat peanuts or foods containing  peanuts (such as peanut butter)  during pregnancy, you can choose  to do so as part of a healthy   balanced diet, unless you are  allergic to them or your health  professional advises you not to.   You may have heard that some   women have, in the past, chosen  not to eat peanuts when they  were pregnant. This is because the  government previously advised  women that they may wish to  avoid eating peanuts during  pregnancy if there was a history   of allergy in their child’s immediate  family (such as asthma, eczema,  hayfever, food allergy or other  types of allergy). But this advice  has now been changed because  the latest research has shown that  there is no clear evidence to say  if eating or not eating peanuts  during pregnancy affects the  chances of your baby developing  a peanut allergy.   • Unpasteurised milk. Drink only   pasteurised or UHT milk which  has been pasteurised. If only raw  or green-top milk is available, boil  it ﬁrst. Don’t drink unpasteurised  goats’ or sheep’s milk or eat  certain food that is made out of  them, e.g. soft goats’ cheese.  Your weight  Most women gain between  10kg and 12.5kg (22–28lb) while  pregnant. Weight gain varies  a great deal and depends on  your weight before pregnancy.   Much of the extra weight is due  to the baby growing. Putting  on too much weight can affect  your health and increase your  blood pressure. Equally, it is  important that you do not  diet, but eat healthily. Try and  stay active by keeping up your  normal daily activity or exercise.  If you are concerned, talk to  your midwife or GP. They may  give you advice if you weigh  more than 100kg (about 15½  stone) or less than 50kg (about  8 stone).  26    The best source of vitamin D is   summer sunlight. The amount of  time you need in the sun to make  enough vitamin D is different  for every person and depends  on things like skin type, time of  day and time of the year. But  you don’t need to sunbathe: the  amount of sun you need to make  enough vitamin D is less than the  amount that causes tanning or  burning. If you have dark skin or  always cover your skin, you may  be at particular risk of vitamin D  deﬁciency. Talk to your midwife  or doctor if you are worried  about this. (See also ‘Vitamin  supplements’ on page 28.)  •  Iron. If you are short of iron,   you will probably get very  tired and you can become  anaemic. Lean meat, green, leafy  vegetables, dried fruit and nuts  (see page 26 about avoiding  peanuts) all contain iron. Many  breakfast cereals have iron  added. If the iron level in your  blood becomes low, your GP or  midwife will advise you to take  iron supplements. These are  available as tablets or a liquid.  •  Vitamin C. You need vitamin C   as it may help you to absorb iron.  Citrus fruits, tomatoes, broccoli,  peppers, blackcurrants, potatoes  and some pure fruit juices are  good sources of vitamin C.   If your iron levels are low, it may  help to drink orange juice with  an iron-rich meal.  •  Calcium. Calcium is vital for   making your baby’s bones and  teeth. Dairy products and ﬁsh  with edible bones like sardines  are rich in calcium. Breakfast  cereals, dried fruit such as ﬁgs  and apricots, bread, almonds,  tofu (a vegetable protein made  from soya beans) and green  leafy vegetables like watercress,  broccoli and curly kale are other  good sources of calcium.  3     Y O U R H E A L T H    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  27  VITAMINS   AND MINERALS Eating a healthy, varied diet will   help you to get all the vitamins   and minerals you need while you  are pregnant. There are some  vitamins and minerals that are  especially important:  •  Folic acid. Folic acid is important   for pregnancy as it can reduce  the risk of neural tube defects  such as spina biﬁda. If you are  thinking about getting pregnant,  you should take a 400 microgram  folic acid tablet every day until  you are 12 weeks pregnant. If  you did not take folic acid before  you conceived, you should start  as soon as you ﬁnd out that you  are pregnant. You should also eat  foods that contain folic acid, such  as green leafy vegetables, fortiﬁed  breakfast cereals and brown rice.  Some breakfast cereals, breads  and margarines have folic acid  added to them. If you already  have a baby with spina biﬁda,  or if you have coeliac disease or  diabetes or take anti-epileptic  medicines, ask your GP or midwife   for more advice. You will need to  take a bigger dose of folic acid.

You need vitamin D to keep your bones healthy and  to provide your baby with enough  vitamin D for the ﬁrst few months  of their life. Vitamin D regulates  the amount of calcium and  phosphate in the body, and these  are needed to help keep bones  and teeth healthy. Deﬁciency of  vitamin D can cause children’s  bones to soften and can lead  to rickets. You should take a  supplement of 10 micrograms of  vitamin D every day. Only a few  foods contain vitamin D, including  oily ﬁsh like sardines, fortiﬁed  margarines, some breakfast  cereals and taramasalata.   Vitamin supplements   It is best to get vitamins and  minerals from the food you eat,  but when you are pregnant  you will need to take some  supplements as well:  • 10 micrograms of vitamin D  throughout your pregnancy  and if you breastfeed.  • 400 micrograms of folic acid  – ideally this should be taken  from before you get pregnant  until you are 12 weeks  pregnant.   If you are vegetarian or vegan,  you may need to take a vitamin  B12 supplement as well as other  supplements. Talk to your doctor  or midwife about this.  If you have a special or restricted  diet, you may need additional  supplements. Talk to your doctor  or midwife about this.  Do not take vitamin A  supplements, or any supplements  containing vitamin A, as too  much could harm your baby.  Which supplements? You can get supplements from  pharmacies and supermarkets or  your GP may be able to prescribe  them for you. If you want to get  your folic acid or vitamin D from  a multivitamin tablet, make sure  that the tablet does not contain  vitamin A (or retinol).  Healthy Start vitamins for women  contain the correct amount of  folic acid and vitamin D and are  free from the NHS without a  prescription to pregnant women  receiving Healthy Start vouchers.  Ask your GP or pharmacist   for advice if you are unsure   (see ‘Healthy Start’ on this page).   Your primary care trust and  local pharmacies may sell this  supplement to women who  don’t receive it free.   28  Healthy Start   Healthy Start is a scheme that provides vouchers that can be  exchanged for milk, fresh fruit and vegetables and infant formula  milk. You can also receive free vitamins.   You qualify for Healthy Start if you are pregnant or have a child  under four years old, and you and your family receive one of   the following:  •	(cid:41)(cid:78)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:77)(cid:69)	(cid:51)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:84)(cid:14) •	(cid:41)(cid:78)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:77)(cid:69)(cid:13)(cid:66)(cid:65)(cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:68)	(cid:42)(cid:79)(cid:66)(cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:69)(cid:75)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:7)(cid:83)	(cid:33)(cid:76)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:65)(cid:78)(cid:67)(cid:69)(cid:14) •	(cid:35)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:68)	(cid:52)(cid:65)(cid:88)	(cid:35)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:84)	(cid:65)(cid:78)(cid:68)	(cid:72)(cid:65)(cid:86)(cid:69)	(cid:65)(cid:78)	(cid:65)(cid:78)(cid:78)(cid:85)(cid:65)(cid:76)	(cid:70)(cid:65)(cid:77)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:89)	(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:77)(cid:69)	(cid:79)(cid:70)	(cid:97)(cid:17)(cid:22)(cid:12)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:16)	(cid:79)(cid:82)	  less (2008/09).  •	(cid:55)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:75)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:71)	(cid:52)(cid:65)(cid:88)	(cid:35)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:84)	(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78)(cid:13)(cid:79)(cid:78)	(cid:8)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:84)	(cid:78)(cid:79)(cid:84)	(cid:55)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:75)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:71)	(cid:52)(cid:65)(cid:88)	(cid:35)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:84)(cid:9)(cid:14)	(cid:55)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:75)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:71)	  (cid:52)(cid:65)(cid:88)	(cid:35)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:84)	(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78)(cid:13)(cid:79)(cid:78)	(cid:73)(cid:83)	(cid:84)(cid:72)(cid:69)	(cid:55)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:75)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:71)	(cid:52)(cid:65)(cid:88)	(cid:35)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:84)	(cid:89)(cid:79)(cid:85)	(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:69)(cid:73)(cid:86)(cid:69)	(cid:73)(cid:78)	(cid:84)(cid:72)(cid:69)	  four weeks immediately after you have stopped working for   16 hours or more per week.

However, you might  ﬁnd it hard to get enough iron and  vitamin B12. Talk to your doctor or  midwife about how you can make  sure that you are getting enough   of these important nutrients.   to a dietician who can give you  advice on how to get the nutrients  you need for you and your baby.  For further information, visit:  More information  You should also talk to your doctor or  midwife if you have a restricted diet  because you have a food intolerance  (such as coeliac disease) or for  religious reasons.

To order your free  DVD, call the NHS Pregnancy  Smoking Helpline on   0800 169 9 169, or visit   www.nhs.uk/smokefree  The NHS Pregnancy  Smoking Helpline on 0800 169 9 169  is open from 12pm to 9pm  every day and offers free  help, support and advice   on stopping smoking   when you are pregnant.   You can also sign up to receive  ongoing advice and support   at a time that suits you.   You can also ask your  midwife, health visitor,  practice nurse or pharmacist  for advice and for the   details of your local NHS   Stop Smoking Service.   They offer one-to-one or  group sessions with trained  stop smoking advisers and  may even have a pregnancy  stop smoking specialist.   They can offer advice   about dealing with stress,  weight gain and nicotine  replacement therapy to help  you manage your cravings.   30  SMOKING Every cigarette you smoke harms your baby. Cigarettes restrict the essential  oxygen supply to your baby. So their tiny heart has to beat harder every time  you smoke. Cigarettes contain over 4,000 chemicals. Protecting your baby  from tobacco smoke is one of the best things you can do to give your child  a healthy start in life.   It’s never too late to stop. If you stop smoking now Stopping smoking will beneﬁt both you and your baby immediately.   Carbon monoxide and chemicals will clear from the body and oxygen   levels will return to normal.  Stopping smoking action plan  1  Think Think about:   • what you and your baby will gain if you stop smoking (see above) • how much smoking costs you.  • What else could you spend your money on? How can you treat   yourself or your baby with the money you save?  • What is keeping you smoking?  List your top ﬁve reasons for going smokefree; e.g. protecting your  health or the health of your baby.  1  2  3  4  5  If you stop smoking: • You will have less morning   sickness and fewer complications   in pregnancy.   • You are more likely to have  a healthier pregnancy and a  healthier baby.  • You will reduce the risk of stillbirth. • You will cope better with the birth. • Your baby will cope better with   any birth complications.  • Your baby is less likely to be born   too early and have to face the  additional breathing, feeding   and health problems which   often go with being premature  (see Chapter 14).  • Your baby is less likely to be born  underweight and have a problem  keeping warm. Babies of mothers  who smoke are, on average, 200g  (about 8oz) lighter than other  babies. These babies may have  problems during and after labour  and are more prone to infection.  • You will reduce the risk of cot  death (see page 129 for more  information about how to   reduce the risk of cot death).   It will also be better for your baby  later in life. Children whose   parents smoke are more likely to  suffer from illnesses which need  hospital treatment (such as asthma).  The sooner you stop, the better.   But stopping even in the last few  weeks of pregnancy will beneﬁt   you and your baby.   2  Get help  Take advantage of the free NHS support that is available to you. You are four times more   likely to quit successfully with NHS support. See the ‘Help and support’ box on the left for   more information.  Ask your friends and family to help and support you.   3  Prepare  If you understand why you smoke and what triggers your smoking, you will be able to prepare   yourself so that you can cope when you quit. It can help to:  • give up with somebody else, so that you can support each other  • change the habits you associate with smoking, and  • plan how you will deal with difﬁcult situations without the use of cigarettes.  Choose a day to stop. Will the ﬁrst few days be easier during a working week or over a weekend?   When you are busy or relaxed? Whatever you choose, stop completely on that day.   Review your plan and get rid of all of your cigarettes the day before your day for stopping.  My chosen day for stopping smoking is:  4  Stop smoking  Lots of people start smoking again because they feel they cannot cope with the withdrawal  symptoms. The ﬁrst few days may not be much fun but the symptoms are a sign that your body   is starting to recover.   Take one day at a time and reward yourself for success.   Go through your list of reasons for going smokefree to remind yourself why you have given up.   If you have had a scan, use your scan images to keep you going through the times when   you are ﬁnding it tough.  3     Y O U R H E A L T H    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  31  Secondhand smoke If your partner or anyone else who  lives with you smokes, it can affect  you and your baby both before   and after birth. You may also ﬁnd   it more difﬁcult to quit.   Secondhand smoke can cause low  birth weight and cot death. Infants  of parents who smoke are more  likely to be admitted to hospital for  bronchitis and pneumonia during  the ﬁrst year of life, and more than  17,000 children under the age of  ﬁve are admitted to hospital every  year because of the effects of  secondhand smoke.   What is a   unit of alcohol?   One UK unit is 10ml, or 8g,   of pure alcohol. A unit is:  ALCOHOL When you drink, alcohol reaches  your baby through the placenta.  Too much exposure to alcohol  can seriously affect your baby’s  development.  Because of this risk, pregnant  women or women trying to conceive  should avoid drinking alcohol. If you  do choose to drink, then protect  your baby by not drinking more  than 1 to 2 units of alcohol once or  twice a week, and don’t get drunk.  Additional advice from the National  Institute for Health and Clinical  Excellence (NICE) advises women  to avoid alcohol in the ﬁrst three  months in particular, because of the  increased risk of miscarriage.  When you drink, alcohol passes from  your blood, through the placenta, to  your baby. A baby’s liver is one of the  last organs to develop fully and does  not mature until the latter half of  pregnancy. Your baby cannot process  alcohol as well as you can.  or  or  1/2 pint of beer, lager   a single measure (25ml)   1/2 standard (175ml)   or cider    at 3.5% ABV  of spirit (whisky, gin,  bacardi, vodka, etc.)    at 40% ABV  glass of wine   at 11.5% ABV  To ﬁnd out more about units, visit the Know Your Limits website   at www.nhs.uk/units  32  Drinking is not just dangerous for  the baby in the ﬁrst three months:  alcohol can affect your baby  throughout pregnancy. And if you  drink heavily during pregnancy, a  particular group of problems could  develop that are known as Fetal  Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children  with this syndrome have:  •  restricted growth •  facial abnormalities • learning and behavioural   disorders.  Drinking more than 1 to 2 units  once or twice a week, as well as  binge drinking, may be associated  with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is  likely to be greater the more   you drink.  If you are drinking with friends:  •  ﬁnd a non-alcoholic drink that   you enjoy  • sip any alcohol you do drink slowly   to make it last  •  don’t let people pressure you into   drinking, and  •  avoid getting drunk.  Help and support  Getting help with  drinking  If you have difﬁculty cutting  down what you drink, talk to  your doctor, midwife, pharmacist  or other healthcare professional.  Conﬁdential help and support is  available from local counselling  services (look in the telephone  directory or contact Drinkline   on 0800 917 8282).   You should talk to your midwife  if you have any concerns you  have about your drinking around  the time of conception and early  pregnancy. You can get more  advice from www.nhs.uk/units   PILLS, MEDICINES  AND OTHER DRUGS  Some medicines, including some  common painkillers, can harm your  baby’s health but some are safe, for  example medication to treat long- term conditions such as asthma,  thyroid disease, diabetes and epilepsy.  To be on the safe side, you should:  •  always check with your doctor,  midwife or pharmacist before  taking any medicine  •  make sure that your doctor,   dentist or other health professional  knows you are pregnant before      they prescribe you anything or  give you treatment  •  talk to your doctor if you take   regular medication – ideally before  you start trying for a baby or  as soon as you ﬁnd out you are  pregnant, and  •  use as few over the counter   medicines as possible.  Medicines and treatments that are  usually safe include paracetamol,  most antibiotics, dental treatments  (including local anaesthetics), some  immunisations (including tetanus  and ﬂu injections) and nicotine  replacement therapy. But you  should always check with your GP,  pharmacist or midwife ﬁrst.   ILLEGAL DRUGS  Illegal drugs like cannabis, ecstasy,  cocaine and heroin can harm your  baby. If you use any of these drugs,  it is important to talk to your doctor  or midwife so that they can provide  you with advice and support to  help you stop. They can also refer  you for additional support. Some  dependent drug users initially need  drug treatment to stabilise or come  off drugs to keep the baby safe.

They will strengthen  your muscles so that you can carry  extra weight, make your joints  stronger, improve your circulation,  ease backache and generally  make you feel well.  Stomach-strengthening  exercises  These strengthen your stomach  (abdominal) muscles and ease  backache, which can be a  problem in pregnancy. As your  baby gets bigger you may  ﬁnd that the hollow in your  lower back becomes more  pronounced, which can lead   to backache.  •  Start in a box position (on all  fours), with your knees under  your hips, your hands under  your shoulders, your ﬁngers  facing forward and your  stomach muscles lifted so that  your back is straight.  •  Pull in your stomach muscles   and raise your back up  towards the ceiling, curling  your trunk and allowing your  head to relax gently forward.  Don’t let your elbows lock.  Herbal and homeopathic   remedies and  aromatherapy   Not all ‘natural’ remedies are  safe in pregnancy. Contact the  Institute for Complementary   and Natural Medicine to make  sure that your practitioner   is qualiﬁed (see page 183).   Tell your practitioner that you are  pregnant, and tell your midwife  or doctor and pharmacist which  remedies you are using.  X-RAYS X-rays should be avoided in  pregnancy if possible. Make sure that  your dentist knows you are pregnant.  KEEPING ACTIVE The more active and ﬁt you are  during pregnancy, the easier it will  be for you to adapt to your changing  shape and weight gain. It will also  help you to cope with labour and to  get back into shape after the birth.   Keep up your normal daily physical  activity or exercise (sport, dancing  or just walking to the shops  and back) for as long as you  feel comfortable. Don’t exhaust  yourself, and remember that you  may need to slow down as your  pregnancy progresses or if your  doctor advises you to. As a general  rule, you should be able to hold   a conversation as you exercise.   If you become breathless as  you talk, then you are probably  exercising too strenuously.   If you were inactive before you were  pregnant, don’t suddenly take up  strenuous exercise. If you start an  aerobic exercise programme, begin  with no more than 15 minutes’  continuous exercise, three times per  week. Increase this gradually to a  maximum of 30-minute sessions,  four times a week. Inform the  instructor that you are pregnant.  Exercise tips •  Exercise doesn’t have to be  strenuous to be beneﬁcial.   •  Make sure that you warm up   and cool down.   •  Try to keep active on a daily basis.  Half an hour of walking each day   can be enough. If you cannot  manage that, any amount is  better than nothing.  •  Avoid any strenuous exercise   in hot weather.  •  Drink plenty of water and   other ﬂuids.  •  If you go to exercise classes,   make sure that your teacher is  properly qualiﬁed and knows that  you are pregnant and how far  your pregnancy has progressed. •  You might like to try swimming,  because the water will support  your increased weight. Some local  swimming pools provide aquanatal  classes with qualiﬁed instructors.  Exercises to avoid • Lying ﬂat on your back – particularly  after 16 weeks. The ‘bump’ presses  on the big blood vessels and can  make you feel faint.  • Contact sports where there  is a risk of being hit, such as  kickboxing, judo or squash.  • Horse riding, downhill skiing, ice  hockey, gymnastics and cycling,  because there is a risk of falling.  • Scuba diving, because the   baby has no protection against  decompression sickness and   gas embolism.  • Exercising at heights over   2,500 metres until you have  acclimatised. This is because   you and your baby are at risk   of acute mountain sickness  (decrease in oxygen).  34  •  Hold for a few seconds then   slowly return to the box position.  •  Take care not to hollow your   back – it should always return   to a straight or neutral position. •  Do this slowly and rhythmically  10 times, making your muscles  work hard and moving your back  carefully. Only move your back   as far as you can comfortably.  Pelvic tilt exercises Stand with your shoulders and  bottom against a wall. Keep your  knees soft. Pull your belly button  towards your spine, so that your  back ﬂattens against the wall.   Hold for four seconds and release.  Repeat up to 10 times.

They improve blood  circulation, reduce swelling in the  ankles and prevent cramp in the   calf muscles.  •  Bend and stretch your foot   vigorously up and down 30 times.  •  Rotate your foot eight times  one way and eight times the   other way.   •  Repeat with the other foot.  To protect your back •  Sit up straight with your bottom   against the back of your chair.  Tuck a small cushion behind your  waist if you wish.  •  When you pick something up,   bend your knees, not your back.  •  Try to stand tall.  •  Close up your back passage   as if trying to prevent a bowel  movement.  •  At the same time, draw in your   vagina as if you are gripping   a tampon, and your urethra   as if to stop the ﬂow of urine. •  First do this exercise quickly –  tightening and releasing the  muscles straight away.  •  Then do it slowly, holding the  contractions for as long as you  can before you relax. Try to count  to 10.  •  Try to do three sets of eight   squeezes every day. To help you  remember, you could do them  once at each meal.  As well as these exercises, you   will also need to practise tightening  up the pelvic ﬂoor before and  during coughing and sneezing.   Ask your midwife or doctor    about these exercises.

Your doctor or midwife will discuss,  the test with you, and counselling  will be available if the result is  positive. You can also go to a GUM  clinic for an HIV test and advice.  Current evidence suggests that  an HIV positive mother in good  health and without symptoms  of the infection is unlikely to be  adversely affected by pregnancy.  HIV positive mothers can pass  on the virus through breastmilk.  However, it is possible to reduce the  risk of transmitting HIV to your baby  during pregnancy and after birth  (see box on page 47).   If you are HIV positive, talk to your  doctor about your own health and  the options open to you, or contact  the organisations listed on page 185  for advice and counselling.   INFECTIONS Rubella If you catch rubella (or German  measles) in the ﬁrst four months  of pregnancy it can seriously affect  your baby’s sight and hearing and  cause brain and heart defects. All  children are now offered a vaccine  against rubella through the MMR  immunisation at 13 months and a  second immunisation before they  start school.  If you are not immune and you   do come into contact with rubella,   tell your doctor at once. Blood   tests will show whether you have  been infected.  More information  For more information, read  the information on screening   tests in Chapter 4 or go to   www.screening.nhs.uk  Sexually transmitted  infections Sexually transmitted infections  (STIs) are on the increase. The most  common is chlamydia. Up to 70%  of women and 50% of men who  have an STI show no symptoms, so  you may not know if you have one.  However, many STIs can affect your  baby’s health during pregnancy and  after birth. If you have any reason  to believe that you or your partner  has an STI, you should go for a  check-up as soon as you can. You  can ask your GP or midwife, or go  to a genitourinary medicine (GUM)  or sexual health clinic. You will be  guaranteed strict conﬁdentiality. You  can ﬁnd your nearest GUM clinic or  sexual health clinic in your phone   book listed under the name   of your primary care trust or at   www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk or you can  call the Sexual Health Helpline free  on 0800 567 123.

Many people with hepatitis C   may have no symptoms and be  unaware that they are infected. If  you have hepatitis C, you might pass  the infection to your baby, although  the risk is much lower than with  hepatitis B or HIV. This cannot be  prevented at present. Your baby can  be tested for hepatitis C. If they are  infected, they can be referred for  specialist assessment. Herpes  Genital herpes infection can be  caught through genital contact with  an infected person or from oral sex  with someone who has oral herpes  (cold sores) and can be dangerous  for a newborn baby. Initial infection  causes very painful blisters or  ulcers on the genitals. Less severe  attacks usually occur for some years  afterwards. If you or your partner  are infected, use condoms or avoid  sex during an attack. Avoid oral  sex if either of you have cold sores  or active genital herpes. Tell your  doctor or midwife if either you   or your partner have recurring  herpes or develop the symptoms  described above. If your ﬁrst  infection occurs in pregnancy, there  is treatment available. If your ﬁrst  infection occurs towards the end   of your pregnancy or during   You may have been  infected with hepatitis  C if you: • received a blood transfusion  in the UK prior to September  1991, or blood products prior   to 1986  • received medical or dental   treatment in countries   where hepatitis C is common  and the infection is not  controlled properly.  Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a virus that infects the  liver. Many people with hepatitis B,  will have no signs of illness, but  they might infect others. If you  have hepatitis B, or are infected  during pregnancy, you can pass  the infection to your baby at birth.  You will be offered a blood test for  hepatitis B as part of your antenatal  care (see page 47). Babies who  are at risk should be immunised  at birth. This is 90–95% effective  in preventing them from getting  hepatitis B and developing long- term infection. The ﬁrst dose is given  within 24 hours of birth and two  more doses are given at one and  two months, with a booster dose  at 12 months. A few babies may  also need an injection of hepatitis  B immunoglobulin soon after birth.  Your baby will be tested for   hepatitis B infection at 12 months.  Any babies who have become  infected should be referred for  specialist assessment and follow-up.  You can get infected   with HIV, hepatitis B,   or hepatitis C if you:  • have sex with someone who   is infected without using a  condom  • use injectable drugs and share   equipment with an infected  person.  You may have already been  infected with hepatitis B if  you were born or spent your  childhood outside the UK in  a country where hepatitis B  is common. (You may have  acquired the infection at birth.)  labour, a caesarean section may   be recommended to reduce the   risk of transmission to your baby. Chickenpox  Around 95% of women are  immune to chickenpox. If you  have not had it and you come  into contact with someone who  has it, speak to your GP, midwife  or obstetrician at once. A blood  test will establish whether you are  immune. Chickenpox infection in  pregnancy can be dangerous for  both mother and baby, so seek  advice as soon as possible. Toxoplasmosis This infection can damage  your baby if you catch it during  pregnancy, so take precautions   (see page 38). Most women   have already had the infection  before pregnancy and will be  immune. If you feel you may  have been at risk, talk to your GP,  midwife or obstetrician. If you do  catch toxoplasmosis while you are  pregnant, you can get treatment. Parvovirus B19  (slapped cheek disease) Parvovirus B19 infection is   common in children and causes   a characteristic red rash on the  face, so it is often called ‘slapped  cheek disease’.   60% of women are immune to  this infection. However, parvovirus  B19 is very infectious and can be  harmful to your baby. If you come  into contact with someone who  is infected you should talk to your  doctor, who can check whether  you are immune through a blood  test. In most cases, the baby is not  affected when a pregnant woman  is infected with parvovirus.  3     Y O U R H E A L T H    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  37  Group B streptococcus Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a  bacterium carried by up to 30% of  people which causes no harm or  symptoms. In women it is found in  the intestine and vagina and causes  no problem in most pregnancies.   In a very small number it infects   the baby, usually just before or during  labour, leading to serious illness.   If you have already had a baby  who had group B streptococcal  infection, you should be offered  antibiotics during labour to reduce  the chances of your new baby  getting the infection. If you have  had a group B streptococcal urinary  tract infection with GBS (cystitis)  during the pregnancy, you should  also be offered antibiotics in   labour. Group B streptococcal  infection of the baby is more likely  if your labour is premature, your  waters break early, you have a   fever during labour or you currently  carry GBS. Your midwife or doctor  will assess whether you need   antibiotics during labour to protect  your baby from being infected.  It is possible to be tested for GBS late  in pregnancy if you have concerns.  Talk to your doctor or midwife.  Infections transmitted  by animals Cats Cats’ faeces can contain  an organism which causes  toxoplasmosis. Avoid emptying cat  litter trays while you are pregnant. If  no one else can do it, use disposable  rubber gloves. Trays should be  cleaned daily and ﬁlled with boiling  water for ﬁve minutes.   Avoid close contact with sick cats  and wear gloves when gardening  – even if you don’t have a cat – in  case the soil is contaminated with  faeces. Wash your hands and gloves  after gardening. If you do come  into contact with cat faeces, make  sure that you wash your hands  thoroughly. Follow the general  hygiene rules under ‘Preparing food’  (page 26).   38  Sheep Lambs and sheep can be a source  of an organism called Chlamydia  psittaci, which is known to cause  miscarriage in ewes. They also  carry toxoplasma. Avoid lambing or  milking ewes and all contact with  newborn lambs. If you experience  ﬂu-like symptoms after coming into  contact with sheep, tell your doctor.   Pigs Research is going on to see if pigs  can be a source of hepatitis E  infection. This infection is dangerous  in pregnant women, so avoid  contact with pigs and pig faeces.  There is no risk of hepatitis E from  eating cooked pork products.  INHERITED  CONDITIONS Some diseases or conditions are  inherited from one or both parents.  These include cystic ﬁbrosis,  haemophilia, muscular dystrophy,  sickle cell disorders and thalassaemia.  If you, your baby’s father or any  of your relatives has an inherited  condition or if you already have a  baby with a disability, talk to your  doctor. You may be able to have tests  early in pregnancy to check whether  your baby is at risk or affected (see  page 49). Ask your GP or midwife  to refer you to a genetic counsellor  (a specialist in inherited diseases) for  advice. Ideally, you should do this  before you get pregnant or in the  early weeks of pregnancy.  WORK HAZARDS If you work with chemicals, lead  or X-rays, or in a job with a lot of  lifting, you may be risking your  health and the health of your baby.  If you have any worries about this,  you should talk to your doctor,  midwife, occupational health   nurse, union representative or  personnel department.  If it is a known and recognised risk,  it may be illegal for you to continue,  and your employer must offer you  suitable alternative work on the same  terms and conditions as your original  job. If no safe alternative is available,  your employer should suspend you  on full pay (give you paid leave) for   as long as necessary to avoid the risk.   If your employer fails to pay you  during your suspension, you can  bring a claim in an employment  tribunal (within three months).   This will not affect your maternity pay  and leave. See also pages 168–169. Coping at work You might get extremely tired –  particularly in the ﬁrst few and last  few weeks of your pregnancy. Try to  use your lunch break to eat and rest,  not to do the shopping. If travelling  in rush hour is exhausting, ask your  employer if you can work slightly  different hours for a while.  Don’t rush home and start another  job cleaning and cooking. If you  have a partner, ask them to take  over. If you are on your own, keep  housework to a minimum, and   go to bed early if you can.  Your rights to antenatal care,   leave and beneﬁts are set   out in Chapter 17.   Computer screens  The most recent research  shows no evidence of a risk  from visual display units on  computer terminals and   word processors.  FLYING AND  TRAVEL  Flying is not harmful for you or   your baby, but some airlines will   not let you ﬂy towards the end of  your pregnancy, and you should  check conditions with them.   You can buy a pair of support  stockings in the pharmacy over   the counter, which will reduce   leg swelling.  Before you travel, think about your  destination. Could you get medical  help if you needed it? Are any  immunisations needed which might   be harmful to the pregnancy?   If you are travelling to Europe,   make sure that you have a   European Health Insurance   Card (formerly known as E111),  which entitles you to free treatment  while abroad. You can get this from:  • a post ofﬁce • by calling 0845 606 2030, or • from www.ehic.org  3     Y O U R H E A L T H    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  Long distance travel (longer than  ﬁve hours) carries a small risk of  thrombosis (blood clots) in pregnant  women. If you ﬂy, drink plenty of  water to stay hydrated and do the  recommended calf exercises.   Safety on the move   Road accidents are among the  most common causes of injury  in pregnant women. To protect  yourself and your baby, always   wear your seatbelt with the   diagonal strap across your body  between your breasts and with   the lap belt over your upper   thighs. The straps should lie  above and below your   bump, not over it.  39  ANTENATAL  CARE  Antenatal appointments  Early antenatal appointments  Regular checks at every antenatal appointment  Appointments in later pregnancy   Blood tests  Ultrasound scans  Tests to detect abnormalities       41 44  45 46 46 48 49  Tests for Down’s syndrome and other  genetic disorders  Diagnostic tests for Down’s  syndrome and other genetic disorders  If a test detects an abnormality  Making the most of antenatal care  Your antenatal team  Antenatal education   50   51 51 52 54 56  Antenatal care is the care that you receive from healthcare professionals during  Antenatal care is the care that you receive from healthcare professionals during  your pregnancy.

It is important to tell your  midwife or doctor if:  • there were any complications   or infections in a previous  pregnancy or delivery, such as  pre-eclampsia or premature birth   • you are being treated for a   chronic disease such as diabetes  or high blood pressure  • you or anyone in your family   has previously had a baby with  an abnormality, for example  spina biﬁ da  • there is a family history of an  inherited disease, for example  sickle cell or cystic ﬁ brosis.  40  If you are working, you have the right to paid time off  for your antenatal care (see page 170).  Information   An important part of antenatal  care is getting information that  will help you to make informed  choices about your pregnancy.  Your midwife or doctor should  give you information in writing  or some other form that you  can easily use and understand. Your midwife or doctor should  provide you with information  in an appropriate format if you:  • have a physical, learning or   sensory disability  • do not speak or read English.  You may have lots of things  you want to ask the midwife.  It’s a good idea to write your  questions down, so you  don’t forget.   ANTENATAL  APPOINTMENTS If you are expecting your ﬁ rst  child, you are likely to have up to  10 appointments. If you have had  a baby before, you should have  around seven appointments.  In certain circumstances, for  example if you have or develop  a medical condition, you may  have more appointments.  Your appointments may take  place at your home, in a Children’s  Centre, in your GP’s surgery or in  hospital. You may be asked to  go to hospital for your scans.   Your antenatal appointments  should take place in a setting  where you feel able to discuss  sensitive problems that may affect  you (such as domestic violence,  sexual abuse, mental illness or  recreational drug use).   Early in your pregnancy your  midwife or doctor should give  you information about how many  appointments you are likely to  have and when they will happen.  You should have a chance to discuss  the schedule with them. The table  on pages 42–43 gives a brief guide  to what usually happens at each  antenatal appointment.  If you cannot keep an antenatal  If you cannot keep an antenatal  appointment, please let the clinic  or midwife know and make  another appointment. What should happen  at the appointments The aim is to check on you and  your baby’s progress and to  provide clear information and  explanations about your care.  At each appointment you should  have the chance to ask questions  and discuss any concerns or issues  with your midwife or doctor.  Each appointment should have  a speciﬁ c purpose. You will need  longer appointments early in  pregnancy to allow plenty of time  for your midwife or doctor to  assess you, discuss your care and  give you information. Wherever  possible, the appointments  should include any routine tests.     Help and support  If you have any questions  or worries, talk to your  midwife or doctor. Talking  is as much a part of  antenatal care as tests  and examinations.  4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  41  Antenatal appointments schedule  Appointment What should happen  First contact  with your  midwife or  doctor  Booking  appointment  (8–12 weeks)  This is the appointment when you tell your midwife or doctor that you are pregnant.

This is because your  midwife or doctor will need time to  assess you and your baby, discuss  your care and give you information.  At each appointment you should  have the chance to ask questions  and discuss any concerns or issues.  Your ﬁrst appointment  with your midwife   or GP As soon as you think you are  pregnant, you should make an  appointment to see your midwife  or GP. The earlier you do  this, the better. At this  appointment you will  be given information  about:   •  folic acid  and vitamin D  supplements •  nutrition and diet  •  food hygiene  •  lifestyle factors that   may affect your health or the  health of your baby, such as  smoking, recreational drug use  and alcohol consumption • antenatal screening tests   (see page 49 for more about   these tests).  Your booking  appointment  Most women have their ‘booking  appointment’ between the 8th and  12th week of pregnancy. This can  take a couple of hours. You will see  a midwife and sometimes a doctor.  You should also be offered an  ultrasound scan.   You should be given information  about:  • how the baby develops during   pregnancy  • nutrition and diet • exercise and pelvic ﬂoor exercises • antenatal screening tests your antenatal care • your antenatal care  44  • breastfeeding, including   workshops  • antenatal education • maternity beneﬁts • planning your labour • your options for where   to have your baby.  More information  See the NHS Choices   pregnancy planner at  www.nhs.uk/pregnancyplanner  Weight and height You will be weighed at the booking  appointment, but you probably will  not be weighed regularly during  your pregnancy. Your height will be  measured along with your weight  so that your midwife can calculate  your BMI (body mass index). Most  women put on between 10 and  12.5kg (22–28lbs) in pregnancy,  most of it after the 20th week.  Much of the extra weight is due to  the baby growing, but your body  the baby growing, but your body  will also be storing fat ready to  will also be storing fat ready to  make breastmilk after the birth.  make breastmilk after the birth.

If you are going to have your baby with   midwifery care in a midwifery unit,   in hospital or at home  You will probably see your own midwife for most of your antenatal   care. You may be offered a visit at the hospital for an initial assessment  and perhaps for an ultrasound scan or for special tests. Sometimes   your midwife may visit you at home.  If you are going to have your baby in hospital   Antenatal care varies around the country. In some areas, the booking  appointment is at the hospital, then all or most of the remaining  appointments are with a midwife or GP. However, if there are  complications, all appointments will be at the hospital. In other areas,   all care is given by a midwife or GP unless there are complications,   which mean a referral to the hospital antenatal clinic.  4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  REGULAR CHECKS  AT EVERY  ANTENATAL  APPOINTMENT Your urine and blood pressure  will be checked at every antenatal  appointment. Urine Your urine is checked for a number  of things, including protein or  ‘albumin’. If this is in your urine,  it may mean that you have an  infection that needs to be treated.   It may also be a sign of pre- eclampsia (see ‘High blood pressure  and pre-eclampsia’ on page 67).  Blood pressure  A rise in blood pressure later in  pregnancy could be a sign of pre- eclampsia (see page 67). It is very  common for your blood pressure  to be lower in the middle of your  pregnancy than at other times.   This is not a problem, but may   make you feel light-headed if you  get up quickly. Talk to your midwife  if you are concerned.  Questions at the   booking appointment  You will be asked a lot of  questions to build up a picture   of you and your pregnancy.   This is so that you are given  the support you need and any  risks are spotted early. You will  probably want to ask a lot of  questions yourself.   You may be asked about:  • the date of the ﬁrst day of your   last period, to help work out  when your baby is due  • your health • any previous illnesses and   operations   • any previous pregnancies   or miscarriages   • your and your baby’s father’s   origins. This is to ﬁnd out if  your baby is at risk of certain  inherited conditions, or if there  are other factors, such as a  history of twins   • your work or your partner’s   work and what kind of  accommodation you live in,   to see if there is anything  about your circumstances that  might affect your pregnancy  • how you are feeling and if you   have been feeling depressed.   At the end of your booking  appointment, you should  understand the plan of care for  your pregnancy and have your  hand-held notes to carry with   you at all times.  Your booking appointment   is an opportunity to tell your  midwife or doctor if you are   in a vulnerable situation or   if you need extra support.   This could be because of  domestic violence, sexual abuse   or female genital mutilation.  45  APPOINTMENTS  IN LATER  PREGNANCY  From 20–24 weeks, your antenatal  appointments will become more  frequent. If your pregnancy is  uncomplicated and you are well,   you may not be seen as often.   Your later appointments are usually  quite short. Your midwife or   doctor will:  You can also ask questions or   talk about anything that is   worrying you. You should be   given information about:   • your plan of birth • how to prepare for labour   and birth  • how to tell if you are in   active labour  • induction of labour if your   baby is late  • the ‘baby blues’ and postnatal   • check your urine, blood pressure,   depression  and sometimes your weight   • feel your uterus to check your   baby’s position  • measure your uterus to check   your baby’s growth  • listen to your baby’s heartbeat   if you want them to.  • feeding your baby • screening tests for newborn   babies  • looking after yourself and   your new baby.  Checking your baby’s  development and   well-being At each antenatal appointment  from 24 weeks, your midwife or  doctor should check your baby’s  growth. To do this, they will  measure the distance from the top  of your uterus to your pubic bone.  The measurement will be recorded  in your notes.  In the last weeks of pregnancy,   you may also be asked to keep   track of your baby’s movements.   If your baby’s movements   become less frequent, slow down  or stop, contact your midwife or  doctor immediately.  You will be offered an ultrasound  scan if your midwife or doctor   has any concerns about your   baby’s growth.   BLOOD TESTS As part of your antenatal care,  you will be offered a number of  blood tests. Some are offered to all  women and some are only offered  if it is thought that you are at risk  of a particular infection or inherited  condition. All of the tests are done  to help make your pregnancy safer  or to check that your baby is healthy.  Talk to your midwife or doctor  so that you understand why the  blood tests are being offered and  so that you can make an informed  choice about whether or not you  want them. Your midwife or doctor  should also give you information  about the tests. Below is an outline  of all the tests that can be offered. Your blood group and  rhesus factor Your blood will be tested to check  your blood group and to see  whether you are rhesus negative or  positive. Some women are rhesus  negative. This is usually not a worry  for a ﬁrst pregnancy but it may  affect the next child.   People who are rhesus positive have  a substance known as D antigen on  the surface of their red blood cells.  Rhesus negative people do not.   A woman who is rhesus negative   can carry a baby who is rhesus  positive if the baby’s father is  rhesus positive. During pregnancy  or birth, small amounts of the  baby’s blood can enter the mother’s  bloodstream. This can cause the  mother to produce antibodies. This  usually doesn’t affect the existing  pregnancy, but the woman becomes  ‘sensitised’. This means that if she  gets pregnant with another rhesus  positive baby, the immune response  will be quicker and much greater.  The antibodies produced by the   46  mother can cross the placenta and  attach to the D antigen on her  baby’s red blood cells. This can be  harmful to the baby as it may result  in a condition called haemolytic  disease of the newborn, which can  lead to anaemia and jaundice.   Prevention of   rhesus disease  Anti-D injections prevent   rhesus negative women  producing antibodies against  the baby and reduce the risk  of a rhesus negative woman  becoming sensitised.  Rhesus negative mothers   who are not sensitised are  offered anti-D injections at   28 and 34 weeks as well as   after the birth of their baby.   This is quite safe for both the  mother and her baby.  Anaemia Anaemia makes you tired and   less able to cope with   any loss of blood when  you give birth. If tests  show you are anaemic,  you will probably be given  iron and folic acid.       Immunity to rubella  (German measles) If you get rubella in early pregnancy,  it can seriously damage your unborn  baby. Your midwife or doctor will  talk to you about what happens   if your test results show low or   no immunity. You will be offered   a rubella immunisation after   your baby is born. For more  information about rubella, visit  www.immunisation.nhs.uk Syphilis You will be tested for this sexually  transmitted infection because if   left untreated, it can lead to  miscarriage and stillbirth.  Hepatitis B This is a virus that can cause serious  liver disease. If you have the virus  or are infected during pregnancy, it  may infect your baby (see page 37).  Your baby will not usually be ill but  has a high chance of developing  long-term infection and serious  liver disease later in life. Your baby  can start a course of immunisation  at birth to help prevent infection.  If you have hepatitis B, you will be  referred to a specialist. Hepatitis C This virus can cause serious liver  disease and there is a small risk that it  may be passed to your baby if you are  infected. This cannot be prevented at  present. Tests for hepatitis C are not  usually offered routinely as part of  antenatal care. If you think you may  be at risk (see page 37), talk to your  midwife or GP. They can arrange a  test. If you are infected, your baby  can be tested within a few days of  birth. If you have hepatitis C, you   will be referred to a specialist.  HIV  This is the virus that causes AIDS.  If you are infected you can pass  the infection to your baby during  pregnancy, at delivery, or after birth by  breastfeeding. As part of your routine  antenatal care, you will be offered a  conﬁdential test for HIV infection. If  you are HIV positive, both you and  your baby can have treatment and  care that reduce the risk of your baby  becoming infected. If your test result is  negative, the fact that you had the test  as part of your antenatal care should  not affect your ability to get insurance.  If you are HIV positive  If you are HIV positive, your  doctor will need to discuss  the management of your  pregnancy and delivery  with you.  • There is a one in four chance  of your baby being infected  if you and your baby don’t  have treatment.  • Treatment can signiﬁcantly   reduce the risk of transmitting  HIV from you to your baby.  20% of HIV-infected babies  develop AIDS or die within  the ﬁrst year of life, so it’s  important to reduce the risk  of transmission.  • Your labour will be managed  to reduce the risk of infection  to your baby. This may  include an elective caesarean  delivery (see page 98).  • Your baby will be tested for  HIV at birth and at intervals  for up to two years. If your  baby is found to be infected  with HIV, paediatricians  will be able to anticipate  certain illnesses that occur  in infected babies, and treat  them early. All babies born  to HIV positive mothers will  appear to be HIV positive  at birth, because they  have antibodies from their  mother’s infection. If the  baby is not affected, the  test will later become  negative because the  antibodies will disappear.  • You will be advised not to   breastfeed because HIV   can be transmitted to your  baby in this way.  Help and support  If you think that you are at risk of getting HIV or know you are   HIV positive, talk to your midwife or doctor about HIV testing   and counselling. You can also get free conﬁdential advice from   the National AIDS Helpline on 0800 567 123 or you can talk in  conﬁdence to someone at Positively Women (see page 185).  4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  47  Sickle cell and  thalassaemia disorders Sickle cell and thalassaemia  disorders are inherited blood  conditions that mainly affect the  way oxygen is carried around  the body. You will be offered a  blood test early in pregnancy  for thalassaemia and asked for  information about your and  your baby’s father’s family origin  to decide if any other tests are  required. The information you give  will help your midwife or doctor to  offer the correct tests and will also  help to give you the correct results  of the test. It is very important  that you tell the midwife, doctor   or person doing the test if you  think you or your baby’s father  have an ancestor who came from  outside northern Europe (for  example, someone who is Italian,  Maltese, Portuguese, Spanish,  Indian, Chinese, African or   African-Caribbean).  Healthy people can be carriers of  sickle cell or thalassaemia without  knowing it and can pass it on to  their children. It’s possible for you or  your baby’s father to be carriers of  these disorders without it affecting  your baby at all. Carriers cannot  develop the disorders, but if both  of you are carriers there is a risk  that your baby could have a sickle  cell or thalassaemia disorder. Your  midwife or doctor will discuss  the implications for your baby.  For further information contact  the Sickle Cell Society (www. sicklecellsociety.org) or the UK  Thalassaemia Society (www.ukts. org) for more details.  Cystic ﬁbrosis Cystic ﬁbrosis is an inherited disease  that affects vital organs in the body,  especially the lungs and digestive  system, by clogging them with thick  sticky mucus. The sweat glands are  usually also affected. The disease  is inherited and both parents must  be carriers of the gene variation for  their baby to be born with cystic  ﬁbrosis. Testing is offered if there   is a family history of cystic ﬁbrosis. Tay-Sachs disease Testing for Tay-Sachs disease should  be offered if you or your partner  is of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and  if you consider yourself or your  partner to be at risk.  Cervical cancer Cervical smears detect early changes  in the cervix (the neck of the uterus),  which could later lead to cancer if  left untreated. Routine smears are  only offered to women over 25.   If you are due to have a cervical  smear (if you have not had one  in the last three years), you will  probably be told to wait until   three months after your baby is  born unless you have a history   of abnormal smears. This is   based on guidance by the NHS  cervical screening programme.   For more information, go to   www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk  Herpes If you, or your partner, have ever  had genital herpes, or you get your  ﬁrst attack of genital blisters  ﬁrst attack of genital blisters  ﬁrst attack of genital blisters  or ulcers during  your pregnancy,  let your midwife  or doctor know.  Herpes can be  dangerous for  your newborn  baby and it may  need treatment.  48  ULTRASOUND  SCANS Most hospitals will offer women  at least two ultrasound scans  during their pregnancy. The ﬁrst  is usually around eight to 14  weeks and is sometimes called  the dating scan because it can  help to determine when the  baby is due. The second scan  usually takes place between 18  and 20 weeks and is called the  anomaly scan because it checks  for structural abnormalities.  Ultrasound scans use sound  waves to build up a picture   of your baby in your uterus.  They are completely painless,  have no known serious side  effects on mothers or their  babies, and may be carried out  for medical need at any stage   for medical need at any stage   of pregnancy. If you   of pregnancy. If you  of pregnancy. If you  have any concerns   have any concerns  have any concerns  about having a scan,   about having a scan,  about having a scan,  talk it over with   talk it ov talk it ov your midwife, GP   your midwife, GP  your midwife, GP  or obstetrician. or obstetrician. or obstetrician.  What do scans tell us? • Check your baby’s measurements.   This gives a better idea of when  your baby was conceived and  when it is likely to be born.   This can be useful if you are  unsure about the date of your   last period or if your menstrual  cycle is long, short or irregular.  Your due date may be adjusted  depending on the ultrasound  measurements.  • Check whether you are carrying   more than one baby.  • Detect some abnormalities,   particularly in your baby’s head  or spine.  • Show the position of your   baby and your placenta.  Sometimes a caesarean section   is recommended – for example   if your placenta is low lying in   late pregnancy.  • Check that your baby is growing   and developing as expected   (this is particularly important   if you are carrying twins   or more).  At the scan You may be asked to drink a lot of  ﬂuid before you have the scan. A full  bladder pushes your uterus up and  this gives a better picture. You then  lie on your back and some jelly is put  on your abdomen. An instrument  is passed backwards and forwards  over your skin and high-frequency  sound is beamed through your  abdomen to the uterus and pelvis.   The sound is reﬂected back and  creates a picture that is shown on   a screen. It can be very exciting   to see a picture of your own baby  moving about inside you.  Ask for the picture to be explained  to you if you cannot make it out.   It should be possible for your  partner to come with you and  see the scan. Although scans are  medical procedures, many couples  feel that they help to make the  baby real for them both. Ask if  it’s possible to have a copy of the  picture. There may be a small  charge for this.  Fetal movement You will usually start feeling   some movements between 16   and 22 weeks. Later in pregnancy  your baby will develop its own  pattern of movements – which   you will soon get to know.   These movements will range  from kicks and jerks to rolls and  ripples and you should feel them  every day. At each antenatal  appointment, your midwife will  talk to you about the pattern of  movements. A change, especially  a reduction in movements, may  be a warning sign that your  baby needs further tests. Try to  become familiar with your baby’s  typical daily pattern and contact  your midwife or maternity unit  immediately if you feel that the  movements have changed.   TESTS TO DETECT  ABNORMALITIES  You will be offered screening  tests that can detect structural  abnormalities like spina biﬁda, which  is a defect in the development of  the spine, or some chromosomal  disorders like Down’s syndrome,  which is caused by an abnormal  number of chromosomes. Different  maternity services may use different  tests, but all tests carried out in the  NHS will meet national standards.  Discuss the tests and what they  mean with your midwife.  Screening tests can:  • reassure you that your baby   has no detected structural  abnormalities  • provide you with an opportunity  to see your baby during the scan • give you time to prepare for the   arrival of a baby with special needs   • allow you to consider the   termination of an affected baby.  Tests can also provide valuable  information for your care during  the pregnancy. However, no test  can guarantee that your baby will  be born without an abnormality.  No test is 100% accurate and some  abnormalities may remain undetected. Deciding whether to  have tests You may not want to have a  screening test if you think that you  would continue your pregnancy  whatever the results. If you do have  a screening test and it suggests an  increased chance of a chromosomal  abnormality, you will be offered  diagnostic tests, which will give  a more deﬁnite diagnosis. These  diagnostic tests carry a small risk  of miscarriage, so you may decide  not to have them. Discussing the  issues with your partner, midwife,  doctor and friends may help you in  deciding what is right for you.  4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  49  Haemophilia and  muscular dystrophy  Some disorders, such as  haemophilia and muscular  dystrophy, are only found in boys  (although girls may carry the  disorder in their chromosomes  and pass it on to their sons). Tell  your midwife or doctor if these or  other genetic disorders run in your  family, as it may then be important  to know your baby’s sex.  TESTS FOR DOWN’S  SYNDROME AND  OTHER GENETIC  DISORDERS These tests are offered to all pregnant  women. There are different ways   of carrying out screening. Combined screening Combined screening involves a  blood test and an ultrasound scan.  All women should have dating and  nuchal translucency scans between  eight and 14 weeks. These scans  may be combined. The blood test   measures two pregnancy-associated  blood chemicals. At the scan, the  radiographer measures the thickness  of the nuchal translucency at the  back of your baby’s neck. This  information is used to calculate your  individual statistical chance of having  a baby with Down’s syndrome.   This nuchal translucency scan can   be used in multiple pregnancies.  For more information about  screening for anomalies, visit www. fetalanomaly.screening.nhs.uk/ publicationsandleaﬂets Serum screening Serum screening is a blood test  that screens for Down’s syndrome,  usually at about 16 weeks into your  pregnancy. It measures three or  four pregnancy-associated blood  chemicals to give your individual  statistical chance of having a  baby with Down’s syndrome.  Serum screening on its own is not  recommended for twin and other  multiple pregnancies.  Screening results Some maternity services give the  result as ‘lower risk/screen negative’  or ‘higher risk/screen positive’.    If the screening test shows the risk   of the baby having Down’s syndrome  is lower than the recommended  national cut-off, this is known as  having a ‘low-risk’ result. A low-risk  result means that you are at a   low-risk of having a baby with  Down’s syndrome, but it does not  mean there is no risk.  If the result shows the risk of the  baby having Down’s syndrome is  greater than the recommended  national cut-off, this is known as an  ‘increased risk’ or ‘higher risk’ result.  An increased risk means you will be  offered diagnostic test but it does  not mean that your baby deﬁnitely  has the condition. The diagnostic  procedure you will be offered is  either chorionic villus sampling (CVS)  (see next page) or amniocentesis to  give you a deﬁnite answer about  Down’s syndrome. Your midwife or  doctor will explain the result to you  and help you decided whether you  want to have further tests.  More information  • www.library.nhs.uk • www.screening.nhs.uk  50  Amniocentesis Amniocentesis can be offered  from 15 weeks of pregnancy if:  • you have a positive or higher   risk Down’s syndrome screening  result  • an ultrasound scan detects an  abnormality that is associated   with a genetic disorder  •(cid:0)your past history or family   history suggests that there may  be a risk of your baby having  a genetic or chromosomal  disorder such as Down’s  syndrome, sickle cell disorder   or thalassaemia.  What happens Using ultrasound as a guide,   a ﬁne needle is passed through  the wall of the abdomen  into the amniotic ﬂuid that  surrounds your baby. Within  the ﬂuid are cells that contain  the same chromosomes as  your baby. A small sample of  this ﬂuid is drawn off and sent  to a laboratory for testing.  Most women feel only mild  discomfort.  Usually, the ﬂuid will be tested  for Down’s syndrome and other  serious syndromes. The   results should be available  within three working days.   If all the chromosomes have to  be looked at, it can take up to  three weeks. This test will reveal  three weeks. This test will reveal  your baby’s sex, so tell your  midwife or doctor whether, at  this stage, you want to know   if your baby is a boy or a girl.   The risks Amniocentesis has a 0.5–1%  risk of miscarriage. At most,  one test in 100 will result in  pregnancy loss. When deciding  whether or not to go ahead  with this test, try to balance  the risk of miscarriage against  the value of the result to you.   DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  FOR DOWN’S  SYNDROME AND  OTHER GENETIC  DISORDERS These tests will give you a deﬁnite  diagnosis of Down’s syndrome and  sometimes other abnormalities.  Your midwife or doctor will explain  what is involved and you will usually  be offered counselling. Chorionic villus  sampling (CVS) CVS can be carried out at around  11 weeks. It can give you an earlier  diagnosis if you are at risk of having  a child with an inherited disorder,  such as cystic ﬁbrosis, sickle cell  disorder, thalassaemia or muscular  dystrophy.  What happens? The test takes 10 to 20 minutes   and may be a little uncomfortable.   Using ultrasound as a guide, a  ﬁne needle is passed through the  abdomen into the uterus.   Help and support  Sometimes a ﬁne tube is passed  through the vagina and cervix  into the uterus instead. A tiny  piece of the developing placenta,  known as chorionic tissue, is taken. The chromosomes in the cells of  this tissue are examined. As with  amniocentesis, a rapid result can be  obtained, but if all the chromosomes  are going to be checked the results  may take up to two weeks.  The risks CVS has a 1–2% risk of miscarriage.  This is slightly higher than  amniocentesis.  IF A TEST DETECTS  AN ABNORMALITY It is always difﬁcult when you are  told there is something wrong   with your baby, especially if you   are faced with a painful decision  about the future of your pregnancy.   Your midwife or doctor will make  sure you see the appropriate health  professionals to help you get all the  information and support you need  so you can make the choices that  are right for you and your family.   Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) (see page 186) helps parents  with all issues associated with antenatal testing and its implications.  They can give you more information or put you in touch with parents  who decided to continue with a pregnancy in which an abnormality  had been detected or those who decided to have a termination.   had been detected or those who decided to have a termination.

Most antenatal services are   now provided in easily accessible community settings.  Waiting times in clinics can vary, and this can be particularly  difﬁcult if you have young children with you. Try to plan  ahead to make your visits easier. Here are some suggestions:  • In some clinics you can buy refreshments. If not, take   a snack with you if you are likely to get hungry.  • Write a list of questions you want to ask   and take it with you to remind you.  Make sure you get answers to your  questions or the opportunity to  discuss any worries.   • If your partner is free, they may  be able to go with you. This can   help them feel more involved   in the pregnancy.

This should stay at about the same   level throughout your pregnancy. If it goes up a lot in the last  half of your pregnancy, it may be a sign of pre-eclampsia   (see page 67).  Your hand-held antenatal notes   At your ﬁrst antenatal visit, your midwife will  enter your details in a record book and add  to them at each visit. You should be asked to  keep your maternity notes at home with you  and to bring them along to all your antenatal  appointments. Take your notes with you  wherever you go. Then, if you need medical  attention while you are away from home,  you will have the information that is needed  with you.   The chart on the right gives a sample of  the information your card or notes may  contain, but each clinic has its own system.  Always ask your midwife or doctor to explain  anything they write on your card.  1  2  3 4  Date. This is the date of your antenatal visit. Weeks. This refers to the length of your pregnancy in  weeks from the date of your last menstrual period. Weight. This is your weight. Urine. These are the results of your urine tests for  protein and sugar. ‘+’ or ‘Tr’ means a quantity (or trace)  has been found. ‘Alb’ stands for ‘albumin’, a name for  one of the proteins detected in urine. ‘Nil’ or a tick or  ‘NAD’ all mean the same: nothing abnormal has been  discovered. ‘Ketones’ may be found if you have not  eaten recently or have been vomiting.   52  38  24  12  6 Height of fundus. By gently pressing on your abdomen, the midwife or doctor can feel your  uterus. Early in pregnancy the top of the uterus, or ‘fundus’, can be felt low down, below your  navel. Towards the end it is well up above your navel, just under your breasts. The ﬁgure should  be roughly the same as the ﬁgure in the ‘weeks’ column. If there is a big difference (more than  two weeks), ask your midwife what action is appropriate.  CEPHALIC   PRESENTATION  BREECH   PRESENTATION  2/5 felt  3/5 engaged  4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  2/5 felt  3/5 engaged  7 Presentation. This refers to which way up your  baby is. Up to about 30 weeks, your baby moves  about a lot. Then they usually settle into a head- downward position, ready to be born head ﬁrst.  This is recorded as ‘Vx’ (vertex) or ‘C’ or ‘ceph’  (cephalic). Both words mean the top of the head.   If your baby stays with its bottom downwards,  this is a breech (‘Br’) presentation. ‘PP’ means  presenting part, which is the part (head or bottom)  of your baby that is coming ﬁrst. ‘Tr’ (transverse)  means your baby is lying across your abdomen.  8 Relation to brim. At the end of pregnancy, your baby’s   head (or bottom, or feet if they are in the breech position)  will start to move into your pelvis. Professionals ‘divide’ the  baby’s head into ‘ﬁfths’ and describe how far it has moved  down into the pelvis by judging how many ‘ﬁfths’ of the  head they can feel above the brim (the bone at the front).  They may say that the head is ‘engaged’ – this is when   2/5 or less of your baby’s head can be felt (‘palpated’)   above the brim. This may not happen until you are in   labour. If all of your baby’s head can be felt above the   brim, this is described as ‘free’ or ‘5/5 palpable’.  HEIGHT  FUNDUS  PRESENTATION  RELATION  OF PP TO   BRIM  FH  OEDEMA  Hb  NEXT  SIGN.

Usually it is nothing to worry about, but  tell your midwife or doctor if it suddenly gets worse as  this may be a sign of pre-eclampsia (see page 67). Hb. This stands for ‘haemoglobin’. It is tested in your  blood sample to check if you are anaemic.  53  YOUR ANTENATAL  TEAM While you are pregnant you should  normally see a small number of  healthcare professionals, led by your  midwife or doctor, on a regular  basis. They want to make you feel  happy with all aspects of the care  you receive, both while you are  pregnant and when you have   your baby.   Many mothers would like to be able  to get to know the people who  care for them during pregnancy and  the birth of their baby. The NHS is  working to achieve this but you may  still ﬁnd that you see a number of  different carers. The professionals  you see should introduce themselves  and explain who they are,   but if they forget,   don’t hesitate to  ask. It may help   to make a note  of who you  have seen and   what they have said   in case you need to  discuss any point  later on.  The people you are most  likely to meet are listed  below • A midwife is specially trained   to care for mothers and babies  throughout pregnancy and labour  and after the birth. Midwives  provide care for the majority of  women at home or in hospital.  Increasingly, midwives will be  working both in hospitals and in  the community, so that the same  midwife can provide antenatal  care and be present at the birth.  You should know the name of the  midwife who is responsible for  your care.    A midwife will look after you   during labour and, if everything is  straightforward, will deliver your  baby. If any complications develop  during your pregnancy or delivery,  you will also see a doctor. You  may also meet student midwives  and student doctors. After the  birth, you and your baby will  be cared for by midwives and  maternity support workers.  • An obstetrician is a   doctor specialising in the care   of women during pregnancy   and labour and after the birth.    Your midwife or GP will refer  you for an appointment with  an obstetrician if they have  a particular concern, such  as previous complications in  pregnancy or chronic illness.   You can request to see an  obstetrician if you have any  particular concerns.  • An anaesthetist is a   doctor who specialises in providing  pain relief and anaesthesia. If you  decide to have an epidural, it will  be set up by an anaesthetist.    care from midwife  your  If you require a caesarean section  or an instrumental delivery   (e.g. using forceps or ventouse),  an anaesthetist will provide   the appropriate anaesthesia.   In many hospitals your midwife  can arrange for you to talk to an  anaesthetist about analgesia or  anaesthesia if you have medical   or obstetric problems. Before   or during labour you will be able  to speak to your anaesthetist.  54  • An obstetric   physiotherapist is specially   trained to help you cope with  physical changes during pregnancy,  childbirth and afterwards. Some  provide antenatal education  and teach antenatal exercises,  relaxation and breathing, active  positions and other ways you  can keep yourself ﬁ t and healthy  during pregnancy and labour.  After the birth, they advise on  postnatal exercises to tone up your  muscles. Your midwife can help  you with these exercises.  • Health visitors are specially  trained nurses who offer help and  support with the health of the  whole family. You may meet your  health visitor before the birth of  your baby and you will be visited  by a member of the team in the  ﬁ rst few weeks after your baby  is born.

Research   You may be asked to  participate in a research project  during your antenatal care or  labour or after you have given  birth. This may be to test a  new treatment or to ﬁ nd out  your opinions on an aspect  of your care. Such projects  are vital if professionals are  to improve maternity care.  The project should be fully  explained to you and you are  free to say no.   Students   Some of the health  professionals you see will  have students with them.  The students will be at various  stages of their training but  will always be supervised. You  can say no, but if you let a  student be present it will help  their education and may even  add to your experience of  pregnancy and labour.  • A paediatrician is a   doctor specialising in the  care of babies and children.  A paediatrician may check  your baby after the birth to  make sure all is well and will  be present when your baby  is born if you have had a  difﬁ cult labour. If your baby  has any problems, you will be  able to talk this over with the  paediatrician. If your baby is  born at home or your stay in  hospital is short, you may not  see a paediatrician at all. Your  midwife or GP will check that all  is well with you and your baby.  • A sonographer is  specially trained to carry  out ultrasound scans. A  sonographer will perform  your dating and nuchal  translucency or anomaly scan.  Some women are scanned  at other points in their  pregnancy.   4  A N T E N A T A L    C A R E  55  ANTENATAL  EDUCATION Antenatal education (sometimes  called antenatal classes) can help  to prepare you for your baby’s birth  as well as for looking after and  feeding your baby. It can help you  to keep yourself ﬁt and well during  pregnancy and give you conﬁdence  as well as information. You can ﬁnd  out about arrangements for labour  and birth and the sorts of choices  available to you (see page 74 for  information about birth plans).   You may also meet some of the  people who will look after you  during labour.  You will be able to talk over any  worries and discuss your plans,   not just with professionals but   with other women and their  partners as well. Classes are also  a really good way to make friends  with other parents expecting babies  at around the same time as you.   These friendships often help you  through the ﬁrst few months   with a baby. Classes are usually  informal and fun.  Choosing an   antenatal class Think about what you hope to gain  from antenatal classes so that you  can ﬁnd the sort of class that suits  you best. You need to start making  enquiries early in pregnancy so   that you can be sure of getting   a place in the class you choose.   You can go to more than one class.  Ask your midwife, health visitor or  GP about what is available in your  area, or contact the NCT (see next  page). Speak to your community  midwife if you cannot go to classes.  The midwife may have DVDs to   lend you, or you may be able   to hire or buy one.  relaxed  and fun  The classes During pregnancy, you may be able  to go to some introductory classes  on babycare. Most start about eight  to 10 weeks before your baby is  due. If you are expecting a multiple  pregnancy, try to start your classes  at around 24 weeks, because your  babies are more likely to be born  earlier.  Classes are normally held once a  week, either during the day or in  the evening, for about two hours.  Some classes are for pregnant  women only. Others will welcome  partners or friends, either to all  the sessions or to some of them.  In some areas there are classes for  women whose ﬁrst language is not  English, classes for single mothers  and classes for teenagers. The  kinds of topics covered in antenatal  education are:  • health in pregnancy • exercises to keep you ﬁt during   pregnancy and help you in labour  • what happens during labour   and birth  • coping with labour and   information about different types  of pain relief  • how to help yourself during   labour and birth  56  The NCT  The NCT (also known as   the National Childbirth Trust)  runs a range of classes.   The groups tend to be smaller  and may go into more depth,  often allowing time for  discussion and for practising  physical skills.

Sometimes these changes  can cause you discomfort or irritation, and you may be worried about what is happening  to you. There is usually nothing to worry about, but you should mention anything that  concerns you to your midwife or doctor. If you think that something may be seriously  wrong, trust your own judgement and get in touch with your midwife or doctor   straight away. This chapter describes some of the minor and more serious health problems and gives  advice on how to deal with them and when you should get help. These problems are  listed in alphabetical order.  COMMON MINOR  PROBLEMS Backache  As your baby grows, the hollow  in your lower back may become   more pronounced, and this can   also cause backache. During   pregnancy, your ligaments   become softer and stretch    to prepare you for   labour. This can put a  strain on the joints   of your lower  back and pelvis,  which can cause  backache.    How to avoid backache •  Avoid lifting heavy objects. •  Bend your knees and keep your back   straight when lifting or picking something  up from the ﬂoor.  •  Move your feet when turning round to   avoid twisting your spine.  •  Wear ﬂat shoes that allow your weight   to be evenly distributed.  •  Work at a surface that is high enough   so that you don’t stoop.  •  Try to balance the weight between  two bags when carrying shopping.  •  Sit with your back straight and   well supported.  •  Make sure you get enough rest  – particularly later in pregnancy.  58  How to ease backache •  A ﬁrm mattress can help to   prevent and relieve backache.  If your mattress is too soft, put  a piece of hardboard under it  to make it ﬁrmer.  •  Massage can help.   When to get help If your backache is very painful,  ask your doctor to refer you to an  obstetric physiotherapist at your  hospital. They will be able to give  you some advice and may suggest  some helpful exercises. Constipation You may become constipated very  early in pregnancy because of the  hormonal changes taking place in  your body.   How to avoid constipation • Eat foods that are high in   ﬁbre, like wholemeal breads,  wholegrain cereals, fruit and  vegetables, and pulses such as  beans and lentils.  • Exercise regularly to keep your   muscles toned.  • Drink plenty of water. • Avoid iron supplements. Ask your  doctor whether you can manage  without them or change to a  different type.  Cramp Cramp is a sudden, sharp pain,  usually in your calf muscles or feet.  It is most common at night, but  nobody really knows what causes it.   How to avoid cramp Regular, gentle exercise in  pregnancy, particularly ankle and  leg movements, will improve your  circulation and may help to   prevent cramp occurring.  5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S     Feeling hot  During pregnancy you are likely   to feel warmer than normal. This   is due to hormonal changes and   to an increase in the blood supply   to your skin. You are also likely to  sweat more.   How to avoid feeling hot •  Wear loose clothing made of   natural ﬁbres, as these are more  absorbent and ‘breathe’ more  than synthetic ﬁbres.   •  Keep your room cool. You  could use an electric fan to   cool it down.  •  Wash frequently to help you   to feel fresh.  How to ease cramp It usually helps if you pull your   toes hard up towards your ankle   or rub the muscle hard.  Feeling faint You may often feel faint when   you are pregnant. This is because   of hormonal changes taking place   in your body and happens if your  brain is not getting enough blood  and therefore enough oxygen.   If your oxygen level gets too low,  you may actually faint. You are most  likely to feel faint if you stand still  for too long or get up too quickly  from a chair or out of a hot bath.   It can also happen when you are  lying on your back.   How to avoid feeling faint •  Try to get up slowly after sitting   or lying down.  •  If you feel faint when standing  still, ﬁnd a seat quickly and the  feeling should pass. If it doesn’t,  lie down on your side.  •  If you feel faint while lying on  your back, turn on your side.  It is advisable not to lie ﬂat on  your back at any time in later  pregnancy or during labour.    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  59  Headaches Some pregnant women ﬁnd they  get a lot of headaches.   How to ease headaches •  Try and get more regular rest   and relaxation.   •  Paracetamol in the recommended  dose is generally considered safe  for pregnant women but there are  some painkillers that you should  avoid. Speak to your pharmacist,  nurse, midwife, health visitor or  GP about how much paracetamol  you can take and for how long.  When to get help If you often have bad headaches,  tell your midwife or doctor. Severe  headaches can be a sign of high  blood pressure (see page 67). Incontinence  Incontinence is a common   problem. It can affect you during  and after pregnancy.   Sometimes pregnant women are  unable to prevent a sudden spurt  of urine or a small leak when they  cough, sneeze or laugh, or when  moving suddenly or just getting up  from a sitting position. This may be  temporary, because the pelvic ﬂoor  muscles relax slightly to prepare for  the baby’s delivery.  Some women have more severe  incontinence and ﬁnd that they  cannot help wetting themselves.  60  When to get help In many cases incontinence is  curable, so if you have got a  problem talk to your midwife,  doctor or health visitor.   Help and support  You could also call the  conﬁdential Continence  Foundation helpline on  0845 345 0165 (9.30am  to 1pm Mon to Fri) or  visit www.continence- foundation.org.uk  Indigestion and  heartburn Indigestion is partly caused by  hormonal changes and in later  pregnancy by your growing  uterus pressing on your stomach.  Heartburn is more than just  indigestion. It is a strong, burning  pain in the chest caused by stomach  acid passing from your stomach into  the tube leading to your stomach.  This is because the valve between  your stomach and this tube relaxes  during pregnancy.   How to avoid indigestion •  Try eating smaller meals   more often.  •  Sit up straight when you are   eating, as this takes the pressure  off your stomach.  • Avoid the foods which affect  you, e.g. fried or highly spiced  food, but make sure you are still  eating well (see pages 24–25 for  information on healthy eating).  How to avoid heartburn •  Heartburn is often brought on by  lying ﬂat. Sleep well propped up  with plenty of pillows.  •  Avoid eating and drinking for a  few hours before you go to bed.  •  Your midwife or GP may  prescribe an antacid if the  problem is persistent.  How to ease heartburn •  Drink a glass of milk. Have one by   your bed in case you wake with  heartburn in the night.  •  Note that you should not take  antacid tablets before checking  with your midwife, doctor or  pharmacist that they are safe for  you to take. Itching Mild itching is common in pregnancy  because of the increased blood  supply to the skin. In late pregnancy  the skin of the abdomen is stretched  and this may also cause itchiness.   How to avoid itching • Wearing loose clothing may help.   • You may also want to avoid   synthetic materials.  Leaking nipples Leaking nipples are normal and  usually nothing to worry about.   The leaking milk is colostrum, which  is the ﬁrst milk your breasts make   to feed your baby.  When to get help See your midwife or doctor if the  milk becomes bloodstained.  Nausea and   morning sickness Nausea is very common in  the early weeks of pregnancy.  Some women feel sick, and  some are sick. It can happen  at any time of day – or even   all day long.   Hormonal changes in the   ﬁrst three months are  probably one cause. Nausea  usually disappears around   the 12th to 14th weeks.   It can be one of the most  trying problems in early  pregnancy. It comes at a time when you may be feeling tired and  emotional, and when many people around you may not realise   that you are pregnant.  How to avoid nausea and morning sickness •  If you feel sick ﬁrst thing in the morning, give yourself time to get  up slowly. If possible, eat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit  before you get up.  •  Get plenty of rest and sleep whenever you can. Feeling tired can   make the sickness worse.  •  Eat small amounts of food often rather than several large meals,   but don’t stop eating. •  Drink plenty of ﬂuids. •  Ask those close to you for extra help and support. •  Distract yourself as much as you can. Often the nausea gets worse   the more you think about it.  •  Avoid foods and smells that make you feel worse. It helps if   someone else can cook. If not, go for bland, non-greasy foods,  such as baked potatoes, pasta and milk puddings, which are  simple to prepare.  •  Wear comfortable clothes. Tight waistbands can make you   feel worse.  When to get help If you are being sick all the time and cannot keep anything down,  tell your midwife or doctor. Some pregnant women experience  severe nausea and vomiting. This condition is known as   hyperemesis gravidarum and needs  specialist treatment.   5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S       I     N P R E G N A N C Y  61  Nose bleeds Nose bleeds are quite common  in pregnancy because of  hormonal changes. They don’t  usually last long but can be quite  heavy. As long as you don’t lose  a lot of blood, there is nothing  to worry about. You may also  ﬁnd that your nose gets more  blocked up than usual.  How to stop nose bleeds •  Sit with your head forward. •  Press the sides of your nose   together between your thumb  and foreﬁnger, just below the  bony part, for 10 minutes and  try not to swallow the blood.   •  Repeat for a further 10   minutes if this is unsuccessful.   •  If the bleeding continues,   seek medical advice.   Passing urine often Needing to pass urine often may  start in early pregnancy. Sometimes  it continues right through  pregnancy. In later pregnancy it’s   the result of the baby’s head  pressing on the bladder.  How to reduce the need   to pass urine •  If you ﬁnd that you have to get up  in the night try cutting out drinks  in the late evening, but make sure  you keep drinking plenty during  the day.   •  Later in pregnancy, some women   ﬁnd it helps to rock backwards  and forwards while they are on  the toilet. This lessens the pressure  of the uterus on the bladder so  that you can empty it properly.  Then you may not need to pass  water again quite so soon.  When to get help If you have any pain while passing  water or you pass any blood, you  water or you pass any blood, you  may have a urine infection, which  may have a urine infection, which  will need treatment. Drink plenty  will need treatment. Drink plenty  of water to dilute your urine and  of water to dilute your urine and  reduce pain. You should contact  reduce pain.

(see page 35).   Ask a midwife or obstetric  physiotherapist (see pages 54 and  55) for advice. Pelvic joint pain  If during or after your pregnancy  you have pain in your pelvic joints  when walking, climbing stairs or  turning in bed, you could have  pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or symphysis  pubis dysfunction (SPD). This is   a slight misalignment or stiffness of  your pelvic joints, at either the back  or front. It affects up to one in four   pregnant women to a lesser or  greater extent. Some women have  minor discomfort, others may have  much greater immobility.   When to get help Getting diagnosed as early as  possible can help to minimise  the pain and avoid long-term  discomfort. Treatment usually  involves gently pressing on or  moving the affected joint so that   it works normally again.  Ask a member of your maternity  team for a referral to a manual  physiotherapist, osteopath or  chiropractor who is experienced   in treating pelvic joint problems.   They tend not to get better  completely without treatment from  an experienced practitioner.   Contact the Pelvic Partnership   for support and information   (see page 187).    coping  with the symptoms  62  Piles Piles, also known as haemorrhoids,  are swollen veins around your   anus (back passage) which may   itch, ache or feel sore. You can  usually feel the lumpiness of the  piles around your anus. Piles may  also bleed a little and they can   make going to the toilet  uncomfortable or even painful.   They occur in pregnancy because  certain hormones make your veins  relax. Piles usually resolve within  weeks after birth.   How to ease piles •  Eat plenty of  food that is  high in ﬁbre,  like wholemeal  bread, fruit and  vegetables, and  drink plenty  of water. This  will prevent  constipation,  which can make  piles worse.  • Avoid standing  for long periods.  • Take regular exercise to improve   your circulation.  • You may ﬁnd it helpful to use  a cloth wrung out in ice water.  • Push any piles that stick out   gently back inside using a  lubricating jelly.  •  Ask your midwife, doctor or   pharmacist if they can suggest   a suitable ointment.  Skin and hair changes Hormonal changes taking place  in pregnancy will make your  nipples and the area around  them go darker. Your skin  colour may also darken a little,  either in patches or all over.  Birthmarks, moles and freckles  may also darken. Some women  develop a dark line from their  belly buttons down to the  top of their pubic hair. These  changes will gradually fade  after the baby has been born,  although your nipples may  remain a little darker.  If you sunbathe while you are  pregnant, you may ﬁnd that  you tan more easily. Protect  your skin with a good, high- factor sunscreen. Don’t stay   in the sun for very long.  Hair growth is also likely to  increase in pregnancy. Your  hair may also be greasier.  After the baby is born, it may  seem as if you are losing a lot  of hair. In fact, you are simply  losing the extra hair that you  grew during pregnancy.  5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S       I     N P R E G N A N C Y  63  It might be more comfortable to lie on one side with a pillow   under your tummy and another between your knees.  Swollen ankles, feet  and ﬁngers Ankles, feet and ﬁngers often swell  a little in pregnancy because your  body is holding more water than  usual. Towards the end of the day,  especially if the weather is hot or   if you have been standing a lot,   the extra water tends to gather in  the lowest parts of your body.     put  Suggestions for swollen  ankles, feet and ﬁngers  •  Avoid standing for long   periods.  •  Wear comfortable shoes. •  Put your feet up as much as   you can. Try to rest for an hour  a day with your feet higher   than your heart.  •  Do foot exercises (see page 35).   your feet up and rest  Sleep Late in pregnancy it can be very  difﬁcult to get a good night’s   sleep. It can be uncomfortable  lying down or, just when you get  comfortable, you ﬁnd that you   have to get up to go to the toilet.   Some women have strange dreams  or nightmares about the baby   and about the birth. Talking   about them can help you.   Stretch marks  These are pink or purplish lines  which usually occur on your  abdomen or sometimes on your  upper thighs or breasts. Some  women get them, some don’t.   It depends on your skin type.   Some people’s skin is more elastic.  You are more likely to get stretch  marks if your weight gain is more  than average. It is very doubtful  whether oils or creams help to  prevent stretch marks. After   your baby is born, the marks   should gradually pale and   become less noticeable.  64  Teeth and gums Bleeding gums are caused by a  build-up of plaque (bacteria) on  your teeth. During pregnancy,  hormonal changes in your body can  cause plaque to make your gums  more inﬂamed. They may become  swollen and bleed more easily.  When your baby is born your gums  should return to normal.  How to keep teeth and   gums healthy •  Clean your teeth and gums   carefully. Ask your dentist to show  you a good brushing method to  remove all the plaque.  •  Avoid having sugary drinks and  foods too often. Try to eat them   at mealtimes only.  •  Go to the dentist for a check-up.   NHS dental treatment is free while  you are pregnant and for a year  after your baby’s birth.  •  Ask your dentist if any new or  replacement ﬁllings should be  delayed until after your baby   is born.  5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S     Towards the end of pregnancy you  may feel tired because of the extra  weight you are carrying. Make sure  that you get plenty of rest.   Tiredness  In the early months of pregnancy  you may feel tired or even  desperately exhausted. The only  answer is to try to rest as much   as possible. Make time to sit with  your feet up during the day and  accept any offers of help from  colleagues and family.   NHS    free dental treatment    I     N P R E G N A N C Y  65  If you have varicose veins •  Try to avoid standing for long   periods of time.  •  Try not to sit with your legs   crossed.  •  Try not to put on too much  weight, as this increases the  pressure.  •  Sit with your legs up as often as  you can to ease the discomfort. •  Try support tights, which may   also help to support the muscles   of your legs.  •  Try sleeping with your legs higher  than the rest of your body – use  pillows under your ankles or put  books under the foot of your bed.  •  Do foot exercises (see page 35)   and other antenatal exercises such  as walking and swimming, which  will help your circulation.  exercise helps your   circulation  Help and support  Contact Netmums,  a unique local network  and source of discussion   – www.netmums.com  Vaginal discharge Almost all women have more  vaginal discharge in pregnancy.  It should be clear and white and  should not smell unpleasant. If  the discharge is coloured or smells  strange, or if you feel itchy or sore,  you may have a vaginal infection.  The most common infection is  thrush, which your doctor can treat  easily. You can help to prevent  thrush by wearing loose cotton  underwear.  When to get help Tell your midwife or doctor if the  discharge is coloured, smells strange,  or if you feel itchy or sore.  Tell your midwife or doctor if   vaginal discharge, of any colour,  increases a lot in later pregnancy. Varicose veins Varicose veins are veins which have  become swollen. The veins in the  legs are most commonly affected.  You can also get varicose veins in  the vulva (vaginal opening). They  usually get better after delivery.   66  The symptoms Some of the symptoms   of pre-eclampsia are:  • bad headaches • problems with vision, such as  blurred vision or lights ﬂashing  before the eyes  • bad pain just below the ribs • vomiting  • sudden swelling of the   face, hands or feet.   However, you can have severe   pre-eclampsia without any  symptoms at all.   Although most cases are mild and  cause no trouble, it can be serious  for both mother and baby. It can  cause ﬁts in the mother (called  eclampsia) and affects the baby’s  growth. It is life-threatening if left  untreated. That is why routine  antenatal checks are so important.  Pre-eclampsia usually happens  towards the end of pregnancy, but  it may happen earlier. It can also  happen after the birth. It is likely to  be more severe if it starts earlier in  pregnancy. Treatment may start with   MORE SERIOUS  PROBLEMS High blood pressure  and pre-eclampsia During pregnancy your blood  pressure will be checked at  every antenatal appointment.  This is because a rise in blood  pressure can be the ﬁrst sign of a  condition known as pre-eclampsia  – also called pregnancy-induced  hypertension (PIH) or pre-eclamptic  toxaemia (PET). It can run in families  and affects 10% of pregnancies.  Your urine is checked for protein   at every visit, as this is a sign   of pre-eclampsia.  rest at home, but some women  need admission to hospital and  medicines that lower high blood  pressure. Occasionally, pre-eclampsia  is a reason to deliver the baby early  – this may be either by induction of  labour or by caesarean section.   When to get help If you get any of the symptoms  described here, or have any reason  to think that you have pre-eclampsia,  contact your midwife, doctor or the  hospital immediately. Placenta praevia  Placenta praevia (or a low-lying  placenta) is when the placenta is  attached in the lower part of the  uterus, near to or covering the cervix.   The position of your placenta is  recorded at your 18 to 21-week  ultrasound scan. If it is signiﬁcantly  low you will be offered an extra  ultrasound scan later in your  pregnancy (usually at around   32 weeks) to recheck its position.   For 9 out of 10 women the   placenta has moved into the upper  part of the uterus by this time.   If the placenta is still low in the  uterus, there is a higher chance  that you could bleed during your  pregnancy or at the time of birth.  This bleeding can be very heavy  and put you and your baby at  risk. You may be advised to come  into hospital at the end of your  pregnancy so that emergency  treatment can be given very quickly  if you do bleed. If the placenta is  near or covering the cervix, the   baby cannot get past it to be born  vaginally and a caesarean section  will be recommended.  5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S       I     N P R E G N A N C Y  67  Severe itching and  obstetric cholestasis Severe itching can be a sign  of a condition called obstetric  cholestasis. This is a potentially  dangerous liver disorder that seems  to run in families, although it can  occur even if there is no family  history. The main symptom is severe  generalised itching without a rash,  most commonly in the last four  months of pregnancy. Obstetric  cholestasis can lead to premature  birth, stillbirth or serious health  problems for your baby. It can  also increase the risk of maternal  haemorrhage after the delivery.  When to get help You should see your doctor if:  • the itching becomes severe –   particularly if it affects your hands  and feet   • you develop jaundice (yellowing   of the whites of the eyes and skin)   • you get itching and a severe rash.  Slow-growing babies Many of the tests in pregnancy  check that your baby is growing.  If you have previously had a  very small baby, or if you smoke  heavily, the midwives and doctors  will already be monitoring your  pregnancy closely. Blood pressure  checks may also pick up signs that  there are complications. If there is  concern about your baby’s health,  further tests might be carried out  and your baby will be monitored  more frequently.  When to get help In the last weeks of pregnancy,   you should keep track of your  baby’s movements. If you notice  your baby’s movements becoming  less frequent or stopping, it may   be a sign that your baby is unwell.  You should contact your midwife   or doctor immediately.  If tests show that your baby is  not growing well in the uterus,  your midwife and doctor may  recommend early delivery by  induction of labour or caesarean  section (see page 98).  Seek medical help  You should contact your  GP if you have a sudden  ‘acute’ illness like diarrhoea,  vomiting, abdominal pain  or a high fever.  68  Vaginal bleeding Bleeding from the vagina at  any time in pregnancy can be a  dangerous sign. Some causes of  vaginal bleeding are more serious  than others, so it’s important to   ﬁnd the cause straight away.   Bleeding after sex  The cells on the surface of the   cervix often change in pregnancy  and make it more likely to bleed   – particularly after sex. This is  called a cervical ectropion. Vaginal  infections can also cause a small  amount of vaginal bleeding.  Ectopic pregnancy  In early pregnancy, bleeding may   be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy  or a miscarriage (see page 151),  although many women who bleed  at this time go on to have normal  and successful pregnancies.   Bleeding in late pregnancy The most common sort of   bleeding in late pregnancy is the  small amount of blood mixed   with mucus that is known as a  ‘show’. This is a sign that the cervix  is changing and becoming ready   for labour to start. It may happen   a few days before contractions   start or during labour itself.   Help and support  Always contact your  midwife or doctor  immediately if you have  vaginal bleeding at any  stage of pregnancy.

Some women  describe a pain low down in  the abdomen similar to a period  pain. This does not necessarily  mean that something is wrong,  but if the pain is more than  discomfort or if there is any  bleeding, your midwife or   GP should refer you for a   scan in the early pregnancy  assessment unit. This scan   will show whether the  pregnancy is growing in the  uterus. Sometimes you need   a second scan to check that   all is well.   Deep vein thrombosis  Deep vein thrombosis is a  serious condition where clots  develop, often in the deep veins  of the legs. It can be fatal if the  clot travels from the legs to the  lungs. The risk may increase if  you are on a long-haul ﬂight  (over ﬁve hours), where you sit  still for a long time.  When to get help If you develop swollen and  painful legs or have breathing  difﬁculties, go to your GP  or your nearest accident  and emergency department  immediately.  Vasa praevia Vasa praevia is a rare condition  (occurring in about 1 in 3,000  to 1 in 6,000 births). It occurs  when the blood vessels of the  umbilical cord run through the  membranes covering the cervix.  Normally the blood vessels would  be protected within the umbilical  cord. When the membranes  rupture and the waters break,  these vessels may be torn, causing  vaginal bleeding. The baby can  lose a life-threatening amount of  blood and die. It is very difﬁcult to  diagnose but it may occasionally  be spotted before birth by an  ultrasound scan. Vasa praevia  should be suspected if there is  bleeding and the baby’s heart   rate changes suddenly after   rupture of the membranes.   It is linked with placenta   praevia (see page 67).  5  I     I  C O N D T O N S A N D P R O B L E M S       I     N P R E G N A N C Y  69  CHOOSING WHERE TO HAVE   YOUR BABY  Safety  Making an informed decision   Home births   70  70  71  Midwifery units  or birth centres  Birth in hospital   Birth plans   72 73  74  You can give birth at home, in a unit run by midwives or in a hospital. This chapter gives  information about each of these options so that you can choose what is best for you.  SAFETY Giving birth is generally very safe,  wherever you choose to have your  baby. There is not much evidence  that compares how safe different  places are. However, women   who have their baby in a unit  run by midwives or at home are  less likely to need assistance,  for example through the use of  forceps or a ventouse.  If you choose to have your baby   at home or in a unit run by  midwives, you should be given  information about what would  happen if you need to be  transferred to hospital during  labour and how long this   would take. You should also be  aware that if something goes  seriously wrong during your labour  (which is rare) it could be worse  for you and your baby than if  you were in hospital with access  to specialised care. You may be  advised to give birth in hospital  if you have, or develop, certain  medical conditions.   MAKING AN  INFORMED   DECISION It is important that you and your  partner make an informed choice  about where you would like to   give birth.  It is your choice, and even after  you have decided where  you want to have your  baby you can still  change your mind.  Your midwife will  discuss the options  that are available  to you locally,  though you are  free to choose  any maternity  services if   you are   prepared   to travel.  70  As well as getting information  from your midwife, you can get  information from:   • local maternity units • Children’s Centres • your GP surgery • the NCT, which can put you  in touch with local mothers   (see page 57)  • Maternity Services   Liaison Committees   (www.csip.org.uk/~mslc) • a supervisor of midwives  (see page 74).  You may also want to seek the  views of your friends and family.   See also Chapter 4 on antenatal   care and Chapter 8 on labour   and birth.

In England,  approximately 1 in 50 babies is   born at home.  If you give birth at home, you   will be supported by a midwife,  who will support you while you are  in labour. If you need any help or  your labour is not progressing as  well as it should, your midwife will  make arrangements for you to be  transferred to hospital.   The advantages of giving birth at  home include the following:  • You can give birth in familiar   surroundings where you may feel  more relaxed and able to cope.  • You don’t have to interrupt your   labour to go into hospital.  • You will not need to leave your   other children.  • You will not have to be separated   from your partner after   the birth.  • You are more likely to be looked   after by a midwife who you  have got to know during your  pregnancy.  The things you should consider  include the following:  • You may need to transfer   to a hospital if there are any  complications.  • Epidurals are not available   at home.  • Your doctor or midwife may   recommend that you give   birth in hospital, for example   if you are expecting twins or  if your baby is breech. Your  midwife or doctor will explain  why they think hospital is   safer for you and your baby.   Planning a home birth Ask your midwife whether or not   a home birth is suitable for you  and your baby or available to you.  If it is, your midwife will arrange  for members of the midwifery  team to support and help you.   Here are some of the questions  that you might want to ask:  • How long would it take if   you needed to be transferred   to hospital?  • Which hospital would you be   transferred to?  • Would a midwife be with you   all the time?  • How do you obtain a   birthing pool?  6  I  C H O O S N G W H E R E           T O H A V E Y O U R        B A B Y  71  The advantages of giving birth  at a midwifery unit include the  following:  • You can give birth in surroundings  where you may feel more relaxed  and able to cope with labour.  • You are more likely to be looked   after by a midwife who you  have got to know during your  pregnancy.  The things you should consider  include the following:  • You may need to transfer   to a hospital if there are any  complications.  • Epidurals are not available in   a midwifery unit.  • Your doctor or midwife may   recommend that it is safer for   you and your baby to give birth   in hospital.  MIDWIFERY UNITS  OR BIRTH CENTRES  Birth centres and midwifery   units are home-from-home places  where you can go to have your  baby. These units can be part of   a general hospital maternity unit,   in a smaller community hospital   or completely separate.  the  choices  Planning a birth in   a midwifery unit   or birth centre Midwifery care is available at   home, in a midwifery unit and   in hospital. Ask your midwife if  there are any midwifery units   or birthing centres in your area.  There may be others that you can  use if you are prepared to travel.  Here are some of the questions that  you might want to ask:  • How long would it take if you   needed to be transferred to  hospital?  • Which hospital would you be   transferred to?  • Will a midwife be with you all   the time?  • Can you visit the unit before you   give birth?  • What facilities are available?   Are there birthing pools,   for example?  that are right  for you  72  Planning a hospital birth Your midwife can help you decide at which hospital you want to have  your baby. If there is more than one hospital in your locality you can  choose which one to go to. Find out more about the care provided   in each so that you can decide which will suit you best.  Here are some of the questions that you might want to ask:  • Are tours of maternity facilities for birth available before the birth? • When can I discuss my birth plan? • Are TENS machines available (see page 89) or do I need to hire one? • What equipment is available – e.g. mats, a birthing chair or   beanbags?  • Are there birthing pools? • Are partners, close relatives or friends welcome in the delivery room? • Are birthing partners ever asked to leave the room? Why? • Can I move around in labour and ﬁnd my own position for the birth? • What services are provided for sick babies? • Who will help me breastfeed my baby? • Who will help me if I choose to formula feed? • How long will I be in hospital? • What are the visiting hours?   BIRTH IN  HOSPITAL Most women give birth in an  NHS hospital maternity unit.  If you choose to give birth in  hospital, you will be looked after  by a midwife but doctors will be  available if you need their help.  You will still have choices about  the kind of care you want.   Your midwife and doctors will  provide information about what  your hospital can offer.   The advantages of giving birth   in hospital include the following:  • You have direct access to   obstetricians, anaesthetists and  neonatologists.  • You can access other specialist  services, such as epidurals for  relief of pain.  • There will be a special care baby   unit if there are any problems.  The things you should consider  include the following:  • You may go home directly from  the labour ward or you may be  moved to a postnatal ward.  • In hospital, you may be looked   after by a different midwife  from the one who looked after  you during pregnancy.  6  I  C H O O S N G W H E R E           T O H A V E Y O U R        B A B Y  73  BIRTH PLANS A birth plan is a record of what   you would like to happen during  your labour and after the birth.   To see an example of a birth plan,   visit the online pregnancy planner at   www.nhs.uk/birthplan. You don’t  have to create a birth plan, but if  you want to, your midwife will be  able to help.   If you don’t have access to a  computer, ask your midwife to print  out a copy of a birth plan from the  NHS Choices website. Discussing  a birth plan with your midwife will  give you the chance to  ask questions and  ﬁnd out more about  what happens  when you are in  labour. It also gives  your midwife the  chance to get to  know you better  and understand  your feelings and   priorities.   You will probably  want to think  about or discuss  some things   What is a midwife?   A midwife is a healthcare professional who is  qualiﬁed to care for women during pregnancy,  labour and after the baby is born. They also  care for newborn babies until they are 28 days  old, if necessary. Midwives provide care for  all women and involve other members of the  team, including doctors when necessary.  Midwives help women prepare for birth  through antenatal education and provide  advice about common problems. A nursing  qualiﬁcation is not necessary to become a  midwife, although some midwives have one.  more fully with the baby’s father  and friends and relatives. And you  can change your mind at any time.  Your birth plan is personal to you.   It will depend not only on what  you want, but also on your medical  history, your own circumstances and  what is available at your maternity  service. What may be safe and  practical for one pregnant woman  may not be a good idea for another.   You may be given a special form  for a birth plan, or there may be  room in your notes. It’s a good  idea for you to keep a copy of your  birth plan with you. The maternity  team who care for you during  labour will discuss it with you so  that they know what you want. But  remember, you need to be ﬂexible if  complications arise with you or the  baby. The maternity team will be  able to give advice on your particular  circumstances. Don’t hesitate to ask  questions if you need to.   Read the chapters on labour and  birth (page 85) and the ﬁrst days  with your new baby (page 120)  before talking to your midwife,  to see if there is anything you feel  strongly about and want to include.   What is a supervisor of midwives?   A supervisor of midwives is an experienced midwife who has had extra  training and education to assist and support midwives in providing the  best quality maternity care. Supervisors of midwives aim to make sure  that you receive the best guidance and information about the right  type of care for you. They are there to help and support you if you are  having any problems with your care, or if you feel that your wishes and  requests are not being considered.   The telephone number for your supervisor of midwives should be in  your pregnancy information details (or hand-held notes), or you can  call your hospital’s labour ward/birthing room or your local birth centre.  Discussing issues with the supervisor of midwives will not affect your  care or inﬂuence how you are further supported in your pregnancy,  birth and aftercare.  PALS The Patient Advice and Liaison  Service, known as PALS, has been  introduced to ensure that the NHS  listens to patients, their relatives,  carers and friends and answers  and resolves their concerns as  quickly as possible. If you have any  suggestions or complaints about  your care, make contact with the  PALS service based in hospitals  in the ﬁrst instance.

Your relationships change: with your partner, other  children and also with your parents and friends. Coping with these changes is not always easy.   This chapter is about some of the worries that may come up in pregnancy and suggestions   on how to handle them. What is a problem for one person may not be a problem for you,   and what is helpful advice for some people may not be right for you. So take from these  pages what you ﬁnd useful.   FEELINGS When you are pregnant it can  sometimes seem as though you  have to be happy all of the time.  You may ﬁnd that people expect  you to look forward to the baby,   be excited and to ‘bloom’ all the  time. You too may think that   this is the way you ought to feel.   In fact, you are likely to have ups  and downs, just like any other   nine months in your life.   Help and support  Hormonal changes   and tiredness Hormonal changes taking place in  your body can make you feel tired,  nauseous, emotional and upset –  particularly in the ﬁrst three months.  You may ﬁnd that you cry more  easily, sometimes for no reason,  and lose your temper more.  Being tired and run down can  make you feel low. Try to look  after your physical health and   get plenty of sleep (see Chapter 3   on your health in pregnancy).  If you are feeling very anxious  – for whatever reason – talk to  your midwife or doctor as soon  as possible.     I  G E T T N G P R E G N A N T  75  DEPRESSION AND  MENTAL HEALTH  PROBLEMS It’s normal to have some worries  while you are pregnant and to  feel a bit down from time to  time. But it is a cause for concern  if you are feeling down most of  the time. Whatever the reason  for your unhappiness, or even  if there doesn’t seem to be any  reason at all, explain how you feel  to your midwife, doctor or health  visitor (see page 54 to ﬁnd out  who is who). Make sure that they  understand that you are talking   about something more than just  feeling low. Some women do get  depressed during pregnancy and  you may need treatment to help  you deal with it.   Anxiety It is quite normal to feel anxious  and worried when you are pregnant  – especially if this is your ﬁrst  pregnancy. There are a number of  things that you may feel anxious  about. You may ﬁnd antenatal tests  stressful – because of the possibility  that something may be wrong.  You may be worried about practical  things like money, work or where  you are going to live. You may be  anxious about whether you will  cope as a parent, or about whether  you are ready to be a parent.   Some of these anxieties could be  shared by your partner, friends  or family. It is a good idea to talk  through these feelings together.  Dreams It is normal to have dreams about  your baby. Sometimes your dreams  may reﬂect your anxieties. This is  often because you are thinking  much more about your pregnancy  and the changes that are happening  in your body. Talk to your midwife if  you are worried by this. Ways of coping • Sometimes it helps to share   anxieties with other pregnant  women.  • Discuss any worries, concerns or  anxieties you have with someone  you feel you can talk to. This could  be your midwife, your partner,  your friends or family.  If you have had a mental health  problem in the past, then you   might be at risk of becoming ill  with a depressive illness during  pregnancy and childbirth. It is  important that you tell your midwife  at the start of your pregnancy about  any previous illness. If your mood  changes throughout the pregnancy  then let someone know how you  are feeling; don’t suffer alone   – you can be helped.  discuss   your feelings  76  Antenatal education will   also help to prepare you   for labour and the birth   and to know what to  expect (see page 56).  You will have an  opportunity to discuss   this in more detail with your   midwife, and to draw up a birth  plan, during the later months of  pregnancy (see page 74).  Talk to your partner or someone  close to you. They may be feeling  anxious too – particularly if they  are going to be with you in labour.  Together, you can then work out  ways that will help you to cope.  antenatal education will help prepare you  7        F E E L I N G S A N D R E L A T O N S H P S  I  I  WORRYING   ABOUT THE BIRTH Many women worry about  whether they can cope with the  pain they will experience during  labour and while giving birth.  It is difﬁcult to imagine what a  contraction is like and no one can  really tell you – though they may  try! Exploring ways of coping with  labour may help you to feel more  conﬁdent and more in control.  You can begin by reading the  chapter on labour and birth   (page 85) with your partner or  a friend or relative who will be  with you for the birth. Ask your  midwife or doctor for any further  information, and look on the  internet (www.nhs.uk/pregnancy).   CONCERNS ABOUT DISABILITIES At some time during pregnancy, most expectant parents worry  that there may be something wrong with their baby. Some people  ﬁnd that talking openly about their fears helps them to cope.  Others prefer not to think about the possibility that something  could be wrong.  Some women worry because they are convinced that if something  does go wrong it will be their fault. You can increase your baby’s  chances of being born healthy by following the advice outlined  in Chapter 3. But there are certain problems which cannot be  prevented. This is either because the causes are not known or  because they are beyond your control.  Of all the babies born in the UK, 97% are healthy and 1% of  babies will be born with abnormalities that can be partly or  completely corrected, such as extra ﬁngers or toes. About 2%,  however, will suffer from some more severe disability. Regular  antenatal care and careful observation during labour helps to   pick up any potential problems and allow appropriate action   to be taken.  If you are particularly concerned – perhaps because you or  someone in your family has a disability – talk to your midwife   or doctor as soon as possible.   They may be able to reassure you or offer you helpful information  about tests which can be done during pregnancy (see Chapter 4).  If you have previously had a baby with an abnormality or disability,  talk to your midwife or doctor and see if you need any additional  care during this pregnancy.  77  COUPLES Pregnancy will bring about big  changes to your relationship,  especially if this is your ﬁrst baby.  Some people cope with these  changes easily, others ﬁnd it harder.  Everybody is different.  It is quite common for couples to  ﬁnd themselves having arguments  every now and then during   pregnancy, however   you is worried about the future  and how you are going to cope.  It’s important to realise that during  pregnancy there are understandable  reasons for the odd difﬁculty  between you, and good reasons for  feeling closer and more loving.   One practical question you will need  to discuss is how you will cope with  labour, and whether your partner  wants to be there. Many fathers   do want to be present at their   baby’s birth. The chapter on labour  and birth (page 85) gives some  suggestions for ways in which  fathers can help, and what it can  mean for them to share   this experience.  If your relationship is particularly  problematic, or is abusive, do get  help. For sources of conﬁdential  support, like Relate or Women’s  Aid, refer to the list of useful  organisations featured at the back  of the book (see page 182).  It may be that you do not   have a partner in this   pregnancy and you need   extra support from family   or friends. You may wish   to talk to your midwife   about services that may   be available. See ‘Single  parents’ opposite.  much they   are looking  forward to the  baby. Some  arguments  may be  nothing to  do with the  pregnancy, but  others may be  because one of   SEX IN PREGNANCY It is perfectly safe to have sex during  pregnancy. Your partner’s penis  cannot penetrate beyond your  vagina, and the baby cannot tell  what is going on! However, it is   78  normal for your sex drive to change  and you should not worry about this,  but do talk about it with your partner.  Later in pregnancy, an orgasm  – or even sex itself – can set off  contractions (known as Braxton  Hicks contractions – see page 87).  You will feel the muscles of your  uterus go hard. There is no need for  alarm, as this is perfectly normal.  If it feels uncomfortable, try your  relaxation techniques or just lie  quietly till the contractions pass.  Your midwife or doctor will probably  advise you to avoid sex if you have  any heavy bleeding in pregnancy,  since this risks infection in the baby  – especially if your waters have  broken (see page 87).  Some couples ﬁnd having sex  very enjoyable during pregnancy,   while others simply feel that they  don’t want to have sex. You can  ﬁnd other ways of being loving  or of making love. The most  important thing is to talk about  your feelings with each other.   While sex is safe for most  couples in pregnancy, it may not  be all that easy. You will probably  need to ﬁnd different positions.  This can be a time to explore  and experiment together. Even  early in pregnancy it can become  uncomfortable to have sex with  your partner on top. This can  be because of your bump or  because your breasts are tender.  It can also be uncomfortable if  your partner penetrates you too  deeply. So it may be better to lie  on your sides.  Help and support  thecoupleconnection.net  thecoupleconnection.net   is an innovative new service  developed by One Plus One,  the UK’s leading relationships  research organisation.  thecoupleconnection.net   has been designed to help  couples to cope with   changes and to strengthen   their relationships. Visit   www.thecoupleconnection.net  7        F E E L I N G S A N D R E L A T O N S H P S  I  I  SINGLE PARENTS If you are pregnant and on your  own, it is important that there  are people who can support you.  Sorting out problems, whether  personal or medical, is often  difﬁcult when you are by yourself,  and it’s better to ﬁnd someone  to talk to rather than to let things  get you down. You may ﬁnd  it encouraging to meet other  mothers who have also gone  through pregnancy on their own.   Don’t feel that, just because you  don’t have a partner, you have to  go to antenatal visits and cope   with labour on your own. You have  as much right as anyone else to  take whoever you like – a friend,  sister, or perhaps your mum. Involve  your ‘labour partner’ in antenatal  classes if you can, and let them  know what you want from them.  Ask your midwife if there are  antenatal classes in your area that  are run especially for single women.  Think about the people who can  help and support you. If there is no  one who can give you support, it  might help to discuss your situation  with a social worker. Your midwife  can refer you or you can contact  the social services department of  your local council directly.  Help and support  One Parent Families/Gingerbread  One Parent Families/Gingerbread (see page 184) is a self-help organisation  for one-parent families that has a network of local groups which can offer  you information and advice. They will be able to put you in touch with  other mothers in a similar situation.  If money is an immediate concern, see the chapter on rights and beneﬁts  (page 156) for information on what you can claim and your employment  rights. Your local Jobcentre Plus or Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) will be  able to give you more advice. If you have housing problems, contact your  local CAB or your local housing advice centre. Ask your local authority at  the town hall for the address.

You can contact them on  0800 2 346 346. You can also  search www.childcarelink. gov.uk for your local Families  Information Service or look on  your local authority’s website  for more details.  FAMILY AND  FRIENDS Pregnancy is a special time for you  and your partner, but there may   be a lot of people around you who   are interested in your baby, such   as your parents, sisters, brothers   and friends.  People can offer a great deal of help  in all sorts of ways, and you will  probably be very glad of their interest  and support. Sometimes it can feel  as if they are taking over. If so, it can  help everyone if you explain gently  that there are some decisions that  only you and your partner can take,  and some things that you would  prefer to do on your own.  You may also ﬁnd that being  pregnant puts you on the receiving  end of a lot of advice, and perhaps  a bit of criticism too. Sometimes  the advice is helpful, sometimes  not. Sometimes the criticism can  really hurt. The important thing is  to decide what is right for you – it is  your pregnancy and   your baby.  WORK  If you work, and you like the people  you work with, you may have mixed  feelings when you go on maternity  leave. Try to make the most of these  few weeks to enjoy doing the things  you want to do at your own pace.   It is also a good opportunity to make   some new friends. You may meet  other mothers at antenatal classes  (see page 56) or you may get to  know more people living close by.  You may have decided that you are  going to spend some time at home  with your baby, or you may be  planning to return to work, either  full or part-time, fairly soon after the  birth. If you think that you will be  going back to work, you need   to start thinking about who will   look after your baby in advance.   It is not always easy to ﬁnd  satisfactory childcare arrangements,  and it may take you some time.  You may have a relative willing  to look after your child. If not,  you should contact your Families  Information Service for a list  of registered childminders and  nurseries. You may also want to  think about organising care in   your own home, either on your   own or sharing with other parents.  Care in your own home does not  need to be registered, but you  should make sure that your carer  is experienced and trained to care  for babies. However, if you are to  claim ﬁnancial help with the costs,  either through tax credits or tax   relief on help from your employer,  the carer must be approved  through the government’s  Childcare Approval Scheme.  You can ﬁnd out more at www. childcareapprovalscheme.co.uk  80  MOOD CHANGES  THAT CAN  DEVELOP AFTER  THE BIRTH   OF A BABY If you experience any of the  following mood changes, do not feel  ashamed of how you are feeling.  You are not alone: asking for and  accepting help is the ﬁrst stage of  recovery – particularly for the more  serious conditions. If you think you  are in any way depressed, talk to a  healthcare professional as soon as  you can. Your midwife, health visitor  and GP are all trained to help you,  and many voluntary organisations  offer advice (see the list of useful  organisations on page 182).   The baby blues  As many as 8 out of 10 women   get what is commonly called   ‘the baby blues’. It normally   begins within a few days of the  baby’s birth.    How does it affect you? Common reactions are to burst   into tears for no obvious reason,  or to feel on top of the world one  minute and miserable the next. It is  not unusual to feel anxious or tense,  lacking in conﬁdence or worried.   Remember that having a baby   can turn your world upside down.   In the ﬁrst few weeks and months  you are likely to feel emotionally  and physically drained. Becoming   a parent for the ﬁrst time can   feel like an overwhelming  responsibility and it is very easy   to feel inadequate when other  parents around you seem to be  coping well. You may expect to   love your baby immediately, but   this can take a while and is not  always instinctive, and does not  mean that you are not a ‘good’  or ‘natural’ mother. Many women  experience these feelings.    AFTER THE BIRTH  Having a baby and becoming a  parent are major events for both  you and your partner. Becoming  a parent usually brings changes  to your home life, social life and  relationships. Parents of a new baby  experience a variety of emotions  after the birth. You will feel happy  and proud of yourself, or possibly  relieved that it is all over.   Whether this is your ﬁrst, second or  third baby, the ﬁrst few weeks of  parenthood are both physically and  emotionally tiring. It can be difﬁcult  to ﬁnd time for yourself, your partner  or your family when you have the   24-hour demands of a new baby to  deal with. Meeting the needs of a  baby can be rewarding, but in the  weeks and months following the  birth of a baby you can feel stressed.   It is likely that during the ﬁrst few  weeks and months of parenthood  you will feel a mixture of emotions.   Your health visitor will be available  to talk to you, but it is important  that you talk honestly to your  partner, friends or family about   how you feel.   Being a parent means constantly  experiencing new events and  carrying out new tasks. You will  have to learn a new set of skills to  cope with these situations. Women  do not automatically know how  to be a mother and men do not  automatically know how to be   a father. It is something that you  learn over time.  7        F E E L I N G S A N D R E L A T O N S H P S  I  I  81  If you have twins or triplets, you are  more likely to experience postnatal  and longer-term depression. This  is mainly because of the additional  stress of caring for more than one  baby. Getting out of the house can  be difﬁcult and this can make you  feel isolated. Tamba (see page 188)  can help you to make contact with  other mothers through local twins  clubs and through their helpline,  Tamba Twinline (0880 138 0509).  Postnatal post  traumatic stress  disorder and   birth trauma Post traumatic stress disorder  symptoms may occur on  their own or with postnatal  depression. The reasons women  develop this are unclear, but  women often describe feeling  ‘out of control’ and very afraid  during the birth. This condition  can be caused by:  • a fear of dying or your baby   dying, or  • life-threatening situations.  How does it affect you? The symptoms include ﬂashbacks,  nightmares, panic attacks,  numbed emotions, sleeping  problems, irritable, angry and  irrational behaviour.  If you get any of these symptoms,  you need to talk to someone  about how you are feeling;   your midwife, GP or health   visitor will be able to advise  where to get help.    When you have a baby your life  changes, so don’t be too hard on  yourself – you are only human. We  all learn to be a parent when we  actually have a baby, not before.   Give yourself plenty of time to  adjust to your new life. Find time  to rest and eat a good diet, as this  will help you to become and stay  physically and emotionally healthy.   Talk to someone you can trust  such as your partner, your mum, a  friend, or to your midwife or health  visitor, about how you are feeling.  It can help a lot just to conﬁde in  someone else. Once they know how  you are feeling, they will be able to  give you support.    If you become more unhappy or  upset, or if your low mood lasts  more than a week, then you are  probably experiencing something  other than the baby blues. In these  circumstances, you should talk  to your midwife, health visitor or  doctor – especially if you have had  depression before.   Postnatal depression Postnatal depression affects 1 in 10  women following the birth of their  baby. It usually begins in the ﬁrst six  months after childbirth, although  for some women the depression  begins in pregnancy. It can occur at  any time within the ﬁrst year of the  birth of your baby.   How does it affect you? If you get postnatal depression, you  can feel as if you are taken over by a  feeling of hopelessness. You may feel  angry, but more often you will feel  too exhausted to be angry or even   to cope with the simplest tasks.  Postnatal depression is serious, and if  it is left untreated it can last for longer  than a year. However, early diagnosis  and treatment of postnatal depression  will result in a faster recovery. Quite  often a partner or close family friend  will recognise that there is something  wrong before you do.   If you think you are depressed,  contact your GP, midwife or health  visitor and explain how you are  feeling. Your partner or a friend  could contact them for you if you  want. You can also contact the  Association for Post-Natal Illness (see  page 186) for more information.  82  DOMESTIC ABUSE One in four women experience  domestic abuse at some point in  their lives. This may be physical,  sexual, emotional or psychological  abuse. Of this, 30% starts in  pregnancy, and existing abuse may  get worse during pregnancy or   after giving birth. Domestic abuse  during pregnancy puts a pregnant  woman and her unborn child in  danger. It increases the risk of  miscarriage, infection, premature  birth, low birth rate, fetal injury   and fetal death. Domestic abuse  should not be tolerated.   If you are pregnant and being  abused, there is help available.   You can speak in conﬁdence to your  GP, midwife, obstetrician, health  visitor or social worker. Or call the  conﬁdential National Domestic  Violence Helpline number (see  right) for information and support.  For further sources of conﬁdential  support, refer to page 184.  Puerperal psychosis  This is a much more rare and serious  condition, which affects about 1 in  500 new mothers. Women with a  family history of mental illness or  who have suffered from puerperal  psychosis in previous pregnancies  are at a higher risk of developing   this illness.   Symptoms include hallucinations  (seeing or hearing things that others  cannot), delusions (incredible beliefs  such as thinking you must save  the world) and mania (extremely  energetic and bizarre activity like  washing and ironing clothes in the  middle of the night).   How does it affect you? The symptoms of this illness can  be very severe and sometimes very  frightening for you, your partner,  and your family. In fact, your partner  may be the ﬁrst to notice that you  are unwell. It is important that your  partner or someone close to you  knows the symptoms to look out  for. They will appear suddenly, often  within the ﬁrst two weeks following  the birth of the baby. Seeking help  quickly will ensure that you are  treated as early as possible, to help  you get well again.   Women with this illness are often  treated in hospital. Mother and  baby units are available so that   you will not be separated from   your baby.   there is  help available  Help and support  7  Domestic abuse  If you are in immediate   danger, call 999.

If your partner  was going to be with you at the  birth, you will need to think about  who will be with you instead.   Try to choose someone who knows  you very well.  Financially, you may need urgent  advice and support. You can get  the recommended leaﬂets (see box)  from your local Jobcentre Plus.  As well as speaking to friends, family  and social services, you may like to  contact Cruse (see page 186).  BEREAVEMENT The death of someone you love   can turn your world upside down,  and is one of the most difﬁcult  experiences to deal with. This may  be harder to cope with if you are  pregnant or have just had a baby.  Family and friends can help you   by spending time with you.   A sympathetic arm around the  shoulders can express love and  support when words are not enough.  Grief is not just one feeling but a  whole succession of feelings, which  take time to get through and which  cannot be hurried. If you need  help or advice, contact your GP or  midwife or any of the organisations  listed on page 186. If your partner dies If your partner dies during your  pregnancy or soon after childbirth,  you will feel emotionally numb.   It may not be something that you  get over – more something that you  eventually learn to live with.  Beneﬁts and advice   if your partner   has died  The following leaﬂets are  produced by the Department   for Work and Pensions   (www.dwp.gov.uk):  • What to do after a death in   England and Wales (DWP1027)  • The Social Fund (DWP1007)  (available from www.dwp.gov. uk to download only)  • A guide to the Social Fund   (SB16)  • Having a baby (DWP1031)  Read Chapter 17 for advice  about the following:  • Income Support  • Housing Beneﬁt  • Working Tax Credit  • Council Tax Beneﬁt  • Child Beneﬁt     • Child Tax Credit  • If you were married and your  partner worked, you may be  entitled to Widowed Parent’s  Allowance, based on your  partner’s National Insurance  contributions.  • If you were not married, you will  not be classed as a widow and  will therefore be dependent on  your private arrangements, on  Income Support or on Working  Tax Credit.  • If you are on a low income   you may be able to get some  help with the funeral expenses  from the Social Fund. It is  always worth talking to your  undertaker or religious adviser  to see if they can help.

Knowing all about the stages of labour and what to expect  can help you to feel more in control when the time comes.  •  Two or three comfortable   and supportive bras, including  nursing bras if you are planning  to breastfeed. Remember, your  breasts will be much larger   than usual.  •  About 24 super-absorbent   sanitary towels.  •  Your wash bag with toothbrush,   hairbrush, ﬂannel, etc.  GETTING READY  Whether you are having your  baby at home, in hospital or at a  midwifery unit, you should get a  few things ready at least two weeks  before your due date.  Packing your bag If you plan to give birth in hospital  or a midwifery unit, your midwife will  probably give you a list of what you  will need to pack. You may want to  include the following:  •  Something loose and comfortable  to wear during labour. It should not  restrict you from moving around or  make you too hot. You may need  about three changes of clothes.  •  Towels. •  Things that can help you pass  the time and relax, e.g. books,  magazines, MP3 player.  •  A sponge or water spray to cool   you down.  •  Front-opening nightdresses   if you are going to breastfeed.  •  Dressing gown and slippers. •  Five or six pairs of pants. •  A loose, comfortable outﬁt to   wear after you have given birth  and to come home in.  •  Clothes (including a hat) and   nappies for the baby.  •  A shawl or blanket to wrap   the baby in.  85  Mobile phones Some hospitals and midwifery units  will allow you to use your mobile  phone. Check with your midwife. If  you cannot use your mobile, make  sure that you have a phone card or  change for the phone.  If labour starts early   Labour can start as early as  24 weeks. If this happens,  call your midwife or  hospital immediately.  Stocking up   When you come home you  will not want to do much  more than rest and care for  your baby, so do as much  planning as you can in  advance:   • Stock up on basics, such   as toilet paper, sanitary  towels and nappies.   • Buy tinned and dried food  like beans, pasta and rice.  • If you have a freezer, cook   some meals in advance.  Important numbers  Keep a list of important numbers in your handbag   or near your phone. There is space for you to write  them down at the back of this book.   You need to include the following:  • Your hospital and midwife’s phone numbers. • Your partner and birth partner’s phone numbers. • Your own hospital reference number (it will be   on your card or notes). You will be asked for   this when you phone in.   • A local taxi number, just in case you need it.  Transport Work out how you will get to  hospital or the midwifery unit, as it  could be at any time of the day or  night. If you are planning to go by  car, make sure that it’s running well  and that there is always enough  petrol in the tank. If a neighbour has  said that they will take you, make  an alternative arrangement just in  case they are not in. If you have not  got a car, you could call a taxi. Or  call your maternity unit, which can  arrange for an ambulance to pick  you up. Try to do so in good time. Home births If you are planning to give birth at  home, discuss your plans and what  you need to prepare with your  midwife. You are likely to need   the following:  •(cid:0)clothes (including a hat) and   nappies for the baby  • about 24 super-absorbent   sanitary towels.  86  THE SIGNS OF  LABOUR You are unlikely to mistake the   signs of labour when the time   really comes, but if you are in any  doubt, don’t hesitate to contact  your midwife. Regular contractions During a contraction, your uterus  gets tight and then relaxes. You may  have had these throughout your  pregnancy – particularly towards the  end. Before labour, these are called  Braxton Hicks contractions. When  you are having regular contractions  that last more than 30 seconds and  begin to feel stronger, labour may  have started. Your contractions   will become longer, stronger and  more frequent. Other signs of labour •  Backache or the aching, heavy   feeling that some women get  with their monthly period.  •  The ‘show’. The plug of mucus  in the cervix, which has helped to  seal the uterus during pregnancy,  comes away and comes out of  the vagina. This small amount of  sticky pink mucus is called the  ‘show’. It usually comes away  before or in early labour. There  should only be a little blood mixed  in with the mucus. If you are  losing more blood, it may be a  sign that something is wrong, so  phone your hospital or midwife  straight away.  •  Your waters break. The bag   of water surrounding your baby  may break before labour starts.  To prepare for this, you could keep  a sanitary towel (not a tampon)  handy if you are going out, and  put a plastic sheet on your bed.  If your waters break before labour  starts, you will notice either a  slow trickle from your vagina  or a sudden gush of water that  you cannot control. Phone your  midwife when this happens.  •  Nausea or vomiting. •  Diarrhoea.  Pain relief in labour Labour is painful, so it is important  to learn about all the ways you can  relieve pain. Whoever is going to be  with you during labour should also  know about the different options,  as well as how they can support  you. Ask your midwife or doctor  to explain what is available so that  you can decide what is best for you.  Write down what you want in your  birth plan, but remember that you  should keep an open mind. You  may ﬁnd that you want more pain  relief than you had planned, or your  doctor or midwife may suggest  more effective pain relief to help   the delivery.   has  the timecome?  8  L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  87  TYPES OF PAIN  RELIEF Self-help The following techniques can help  you to be more relaxed in labour,  and this can help you to cope   with the pain.   • Learn about labour. This can   make you feel more in control   and less frightened about what   is going to happen. Read books  like this one, talk to your   midwife or doctor and attend  antenatal classes if they are  available in your area.  • Learn how to relax and stay   calm. Try breathing deeply.  • Keep moving. Your position   can make a difference.   Try kneeling, walking around   or rocking back and forwards.  • Have a partner, friend or relative   to support you during labour.   If you don’t have anyone, don’t  worry – your midwife will give you  all the support you need.  • Ask your partner to massage you  (although you may ﬁnd that you  don’t want to be touched).  • Have a bath.  ‘Gas and air’ (Entonox) This is a mixture of oxygen and  another gas called nitrous oxide.  ‘Gas and air’ will not remove all  the pain, but it can help to reduce  it and make it easier to bear. Many  women like it because it’s easy to  use and you control it yourself.  How it works You breathe it in through a mask  or mouthpiece which you hold  yourself. You will probably have a  chance to practise using the mask  or mouthpiece if you attend an  antenatal class.   The gas takes 15–20 seconds to  work, so you breathe it in just as   a contraction begins. It works best   if you take slow, deep breaths.   Hydrotherapy Water can help you to relax  and can make the contractions  seem less painful. Ask if you  can have a bath or use a  birth pool. The water will be  kept at a temperature that is  comfortable for you but   it will not be above 37°C.   Your temperature will be  monitored closely.   Side effects There are no harmful side effects  for you or the baby, but it can  make you feel lightheaded. Some  women also ﬁnd that it makes  them feel sick or sleepy or unable to  concentrate on what is happening.  If this happens, you can simply  stop using it.  stayingcalm  will help  88  TENS TENS stands for transcutaneous  electrical nerve stimulation. Some  hospitals have TENs machines. If not,  you can hire your own machine.   TENS has not been shown to be  effective during the active phase of  labour. It is probably most effective  during the early stages, when many  women experience lower-back pain.  TENS may be useful if you plan to  give birth at home or while you  are at home in the early stages of  labour. If you are interested in TENS,  you should learn how to use it in  the later months of your pregnancy.  Ask your midwife or physiotherapist.  How it works Electrodes are taped onto your back  and connected by wires to a small,  battery-powered stimulator known  as an ‘obstetric pulsar’. Holding the  pulsar, you give yourself small, safe  amounts of current. You can move  around while using it.  It is believed that TENS works by  stimulating your body to produce  more endorphins, which are the  body’s own natural painkillers.   It also reduces the number of pain  signals that are sent to the brain   by the spinal cord.   Side effects There are no known side effects   for either you or the baby.   Intramuscular  injections of pain- relieving drugs Injections of drugs like pethidine or  diamorphine can help you to relax,  and this can lessen the pain.   How it works You are given an intramuscular  injection. It takes about 20 minutes  to work and the effects last  between two and four hours.   Side effects • It can make some women feel   very ‘woozy’, sick and forgetful.   • If it has not worn off towards   the end of labour, it can make it  difﬁcult to push. You might prefer  to ask for half a dose initially, to  see how it works for you.   • If pethidine or diamorphine are   given too close to the time of  delivery, it may affect the baby’s  breathing. If it does, an antidote  may be given.   • The drugs can interfere with   breastfeeding.   Epidural analgesia An epidural is a special type of  local anaesthetic. It numbs the  nerves which carry pain from the  birth canal to the brain. For most  women, an epidural gives complete  pain relief. It can be very helpful for  women who are having a long or  particularly painful labour, or who  are becoming very distressed.   An anaesthetist is the only person  who can give an epidural. If you  think you are going to want one,  check whether anaesthetists are  always available at your hospital.   How it works • A drip will run ﬂuid into a vein in   your arm.   • While you lie on your side or  sit up in a curled position, an  anaesthetist will clean your back  with antiseptic and numb a small  area with some local anaesthetic.   8  L A B O U R A N D B        • A very small tube will be placed  into your back near the nerves  that carry pain from the uterus.  Drugs (usually a mixture of local  anaesthetic and opioid) are then  administered through this tube.  It takes about 20 minutes to get  the epidural set up and then  another 10–15 minutes for it to  work. Occasionally it doesn’t work  perfectly at ﬁrst, and needs to   be adjusted.   • After it has been set up, the   epidural can be ‘topped up’ by   an anaesthetist or midwife, or   you may be given a machine  which will let you top up the  epidural yourself.   • Your contractions and the baby’s  heart will need to be continuously  monitored by a machine. This  means having a belt round your  abdomen and possibly a clip  attached to your baby’s head.  Side effects  • Epidurals may make your legs  heavy. It depends on the type   of epidural that you have.   • An epidural should not make   you feel drowsy or sick.  • Your blood pressure can drop.  This is rare, as the drip in your   arm will help you to maintain  good blood pressure.  • Epidurals can prolong the second   stage of labour. If you can no  longer feel your contractions,   I  R T H  89  the midwife will have to tell you  when to push. This may mean  that instruments are used to help  you deliver your baby. However,  when you have an epidural, your  midwife or doctor will wait longer  before they use instruments  as long as your baby is ﬁne.  Sometimes, less anaesthetic is  given towards the end so that the  effect wears off and you can push  the baby out naturally.  • You may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pass  water, and a small tube called a  catheter may be put into your  bladder to help you.  • About 1 in 100 women gets a   headache after an epidural. If you  develop a headache afterwards,   it can be treated.  • Your back might be a bit sore for  a day or two, but epidurals do not  cause long-term backache.   • About 1 in 2,000 mothers gets  a feeling of tingling or pins and  needles down one leg after having  a baby. This is more likely to result  from childbirth itself than from an  epidural. You will be advised on  when you can get out of bed. when you can get out of bed.  Alternative methods   of pain relief  WHEN TO GO   TO HOSPITAL   OR YOUR   MIDWIFERY UNIT If it is your ﬁrst pregnancy, you may  feel unsure about when you should  go into hospital. The best thing  to do is call your hospital or unit  for advice.  Some women want to avoid the  above methods of pain relief and  choose acupuncture, aromatherapy,  homeopathy, hypnosis, massage  and reﬂexology. Most of these  techniques do not provide very  effective pain relief. However, if  you would like to use any of these  methods it is important to discuss it  with your midwife or doctor and to  let the hospital know beforehand.  let the hospital know beforehand.

You will probably  be told to come in when your  contractions are regular, strong,  are about ﬁve minutes apart and  are lasting about 60 seconds. • If you don’t live near to your  hospital, you may need to go  in before you get to this stage.  • Second and later babies often  arrive more quickly, so you may  need to contact the hospital,  midwifery unit or your   midwife sooner.   Don’t forget to phone the hospital  or unit before leaving home, and  remember your notes. Home birth You and your midwife should have  agreed what you will do when  labour starts.  90  •  probably do an internal   examination to ﬁnd out how  much your cervix has opened.  Tell her if a contraction is coming  so that she can wait until it has  passed. She will then be able  to tell you how far your labour  has progressed. If you would  prefer not to have an internal  examination you don’t have   to have one.  These checks will be repeated at  intervals throughout your labour.  If you and your partner have   made a birth plan, show your  midwife so that she knows what  kind of labour you want and can  help you to achieve it.   Water births  Some hospitals have birthing  pools (or you can hire one if  there is not one available),  so that you can be in water  during labour. Many women  ﬁnd that this helps them to  relax. It is possible to deliver  the baby in the pool. Speak  to your midwife about the  advantages and disadvantages  of a water birth. If you want  one, you will need to make  arrangements in advance.  ARRIVING AT  THE HOSPITAL OR  MIDWIFERY UNIT Hospitals and midwifery units vary,  so the following is just a guide  to what is likely to happen. Your  midwife will be able to give you  more information about your local  hospital or unit.   If you carry your own notes, take  them to the hospital admissions  desk. You will be taken to the  labour ward or your room, where  you can change into a hospital  gown or a nightdress of your own.  Choose one that is loose and  preferably made of cotton, because  you will feel hot during labour and  will not want something tight. Examination by   the midwife The midwife will ask you about  what has been happening so far  and will examine you. If you are  having a home birth, then this  examination will take place at  home. The midwife will:  •  take your pulse, temperature  and blood pressure and check  your urine  •  feel your     abdomen to     check the baby’s     position and    record or listen   to your baby’s          heart, and  Delivery rooms   Delivery rooms have become  more homelike in recent years.  Most have easy chairs, beanbags  and mats so that you can move  about in labour and change  position. Some have baths,  showers or birthing pools.   You should feel comfortable   in the room where you are  giving birth.   Bath or shower  Some hospitals may offer you   a bath or shower. A warm bath  can be soothing in the early  stages of labour. Some women  like to spend much of their  labour in the bath as a way   of easing the pain.  8  L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  91  To help yourself get over the urge  to push, try blowing out slowly   and gently or, if the urge is too  strong, in little puffs. Some people  ﬁnd this easier lying on their side,  or on their knees and elbows, to  reduce the pressure of the baby’s  head on the cervix.  WHAT HAPPENS   IN LABOUR There are three stages to labour.   In the ﬁrst stage the cervix gradually  opens up (dilates). In the second  stage the baby is pushed down  the vagina and is born. In the third  stage the placenta comes away  from the wall of the uterus and   is also pushed out of the vagina. The ﬁrst stage of  labour – dilation The dilation of the cervix The cervix needs to open to  about 10cm for a baby to pass  through. This is called ‘fully dilated’.  Contractions at the start of labour  help to soften the cervix so that it  gradually opens. Sometimes the  process of softening can take many  hours before what midwives refer   to as ‘established labour’. This is  when your cervix has dilated to at  least 4cm.  If you go into hospital or your  midwifery unit before labour is  established, you may be asked if  you would prefer to go home again  for a while, rather than spending  extra hours in hospital.   If you go home, you should make  sure that you eat and drink, as you  will need energy. At night, try to   get comfortable and relaxed.   92  If you can, try to sleep. A warm bath  or shower may help you to relax.  During the day, keep upright and  gently active. This helps the baby  to move down into the pelvis and  helps the cervix to dilate.   Fetal heart monitoring Your baby’s heart will be monitored  throughout labour. Your midwife  will watch for any marked change   in your baby’s heart rate, which  could be a sign that the baby is  distressed and that something  needs to be done to speed up the  delivery. There are different ways   of monitoring the baby’s heartbeat.  If you don’t feel comfortable with  one of these, tell your midwife.  • Your midwife may listen to your  baby’s heart intermittently, but  for at least one minute every  15 minutes when you are in  established labour, using a   hand-held ultrasound monitor  (often called a Sonicaid). This  method allows you to be free   to move around.  Once labour is established, the  midwife will check you from   time to time to see how you are  progressing. In a ﬁrst labour, the  time from the start of established  labour to full dilation can be  between 6 and 12 hours. It is   often quicker in subsequent  pregnancies.  Your midwife should be with   you all the time to support you.   She will tell you to try not to push  until your cervix is fully open and  the baby’s head can be seen.    • Your waters will be broken   (if this has not already   happened) during a vaginal  examination. This is often   enough to get things moving.  • If this doesn’t speed up labour,   you may be given a drip  containing a hormone, which   is fed into a vein into your arm   to encourage contractions.   You may want some pain relief  before the drip is started.   • After the drip is attached,   your contractions and your   baby’s heartbeat will be  continuously monitored.  • Alternatively, a clip can be put   on your baby’s head to monitor  the heart rate. The clip is put on  during a vaginal examination   and your waters will be broken  if they have not already done so.  Ask your midwife or doctor to  explain why they feel that the   clip is necessary for your baby.   Speeding up labour Your labour may be slower than  expected if your contractions   are not frequent or strong enough   or because your baby is in an  awkward position.   If this is the case, your doctor or  midwife will explain why they   think labour should be sped up  and may recommend the following  techniques to get things moving:   • Your baby’s heartbeat and your   contractions may also be followed  electronically through a monitor  linked to a machine called a CTG.  The monitor will be strapped to  your abdomen on a belt.   supportand  encouragement  Coping at the beginning  •  You can be up and moving about   if you feel like it. if you feel like it. if you feel like it.  •  You can drink ﬂuids and may ﬁnd    You can drink ﬂuids and may ﬁnd  •  You can drink ﬂuids and may ﬁnd  isotonic drinks (sports drinks) help  isotonic drinks (sports drinks) help   to keep your energy levels up.  to keep your energy levels up.

Your birthing   partner can help by doing   them with you.  •  Your birthing partner  can rub your back to   relieve the pain   if that helps.  8  L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  93  The second stage   of labour – the   baby’s birth This stage begins when the cervix is  fully dilated, and lasts until the birth  of your baby. Your midwife will help  you to ﬁnd a comfortable position  and will guide you when you feel  the urge to push.  Find a position Find a position that you prefer  and which will make labour easier  for you.   • You might want to remain in bed  with your back propped up with  pillows, or you may wish to stand,  sit, kneel or squat. Squatting   may be difﬁcult if you are not  used to it.   • If you are very tired, you might  be more comfortable lying on  your side rather than propped up  with pillows. This is also a better  position for your baby.  • You may ﬁnd kneeling on all fours  might be helpful if you suffer from  backache in labour.   It can help if you have tried out  some of these positions beforehand.  94  When the head is visible, the  midwife will ask you to stop  pushing, and to pant or puff   a couple of quick short breaths,  blowing out through your mouth.  This is so that your baby’s head  can be born slowly and gently,  giving the skin and muscles of the  perineum (the area between your  vagina and back passage) time to  stretch without tearing.  Pushing When your cervix is fully dilated,   you can start to push when you feel  you need to during contractions:  • Take two deep breaths as   the contractions start, and   push down.   •(cid:0)Take another breath when you   need to.   • Give several pushes until the   contraction ends.   • After each contraction, rest and  get up strength for the next one.   This stage is hard work, but your  midwife will help and encourage  you all the time. Your birth partner  can also give you lots of support.  This stage may take an hour or  more, so it helps to know how you  are doing.   The birth During the second stage, the   baby’s head moves down until   it can be seen.  The skin of the perineum usually  stretches well, but it may tear.  Sometimes to avoid a tear or to  speed up the delivery, the midwife  or doctor will inject local anaesthetic  and cut an episiotomy. Afterwards,  the cut or tear is stitched up again  and heals.  Once your baby’s head is born, most  of the hard work is over. With one  more gentle push the body is born  quite quickly and easily.   You can have your baby lifted straight  onto you before the cord is cut by  your midwife or birthing partner.  Your baby may be born covered  with some of the white, greasy  vernix, which acts as a protection   in the uterus.   Skin-to-skin contact Skin-to-skin contact really helps  bonding, so it is a good idea to   have your baby lifted onto you  before the cord is cut so that you  can feel and be close to each other  straight away.   The cord is clamped and cut, the  baby is dried to prevent them from  becoming cold, and you will be able   to hold and cuddle your baby.   Your baby may be quite messy,   with some of your blood and  perhaps some of the vernix on   their skin. If you prefer, you can   ask the midwife to wipe your baby  and wrap him or her in a blanket  before your cuddle.  Sometimes mucus has to be  cleared out of a baby’s nose  and mouth. Some babies need  additional help to establish  breathing and may be taken to   the resuscitor in the room to be  given oxygen. Your baby will not  be kept away from you any longer  than necessary.  8  L A B O U R A N D B        The third stage of  labour – the placenta  After your baby is born, the uterus  can contract to push out the  placenta. Your midwife will offer  you an injection in your thigh just as  the baby is born, which will speed  up the delivery of the placenta.   The injection contains a drug   called Syntocinon, which makes   the uterus contract and helps to   prevent the heavy bleeding which  some women experience.   Let your baby breastfeed as soon  after birth as possible. It helps with  breastfeeding later on and it also  helps your uterus to contract.   Babies start sucking immediately,  although maybe just for a short  time. They may just like to feel   the nipple in the mouth.   skin skin  to  I  R T H  95  SPECIAL CASES Labour that starts  too early (premature  labour) About 1 baby in every 13 will  be born before the 37th week  of pregnancy. In most cases  labour starts by itself, either with  contractions or with the sudden  breaking of the waters or a ‘show’  (see page 87). About one early baby  in six is induced (see next page)  and about one early baby in ﬁve is  delivered by caesarean section   (see page 98).   If your baby is likely to be born  early, you will be admitted to a  hospital with specialist facilities for  premature babies. Not all hospitals  have these facilities, so it may be  necessary to transfer you and your  baby to another unit, either before  delivery or immediately afterwards.  Overdue pregnancies Pregnancy normally lasts about   40 weeks, which is approximately  280 days from the ﬁrst day of your  last period. Most women will go  into labour within a week either   side of this date.  If your labour does not start by   41 weeks, your midwife will  offer you a ‘membrane sweep’.  This involves having a vaginal  examination, which stimulates the  neck of your uterus (known as the  cervix) to produce hormones which  may trigger natural labour.   If your labour still doesn’t start, your  midwife or doctor will suggest a  date to have your labour induced  (started off). If you don’t want labour  to be induced and your pregnancy  continues to 42 weeks or beyond,  you and your baby will be monitored.  Your midwife or doctor will check  that both you and your baby are  healthy by giving you ultrasound  scans and checking your baby’s  movement and heartbeat. If your  baby is showing signs of distress,  your doctor and midwife will again  suggest that labour   is induced.  If contractions start prematurely, the  doctors may be able to use drugs to  stop your contractions temporarily.  You will probably be given injections  of steroids that will help to mature  your baby’s lungs so that they are  better able to breathe after the  birth. This treatment takes about   24 hours to work.  Many multiple birth babies are born  prematurely. The normal delivery  date for twins is 37 weeks and for  triplets 33 weeks.  If you have any reason to think that  your labour may be starting early,  get in touch with your hospital or  midwife straight away.  After the birth Skin-to-skin contact with your  baby is important and helps with  bonding. Your baby will like   being close to you just after birth.   The time alone with your partner   and your baby is very special.  Your baby will be examined by a  midwife or paediatrician and then  weighed (and possibly measured) and  given a band with your name on it.   Vitamin K  You will be offered an injection of  vitamin K for your baby, which is  the most effective way of helping  to prevent a rare bleeding disorder  (haemorrhagic disease of the  newborn). Your midwife should  have discussed this with you  beforehand. If you prefer that your  baby doesn’t have an injection, oral  doses of vitamin K are available.  Further doses will be necessary.  Stitches Small tears and grazes are often   left to heal without stitches because  they frequently heal better this  way. If you need stitches or other  treatments, it should be possible   to continue cuddling your baby.   Your midwife will help with this as  much as they can.   If you have had a large tear or an  episiotomy, you will probably need  stitches. If you have already had an  epidural, it can be topped up. If   you have not, you should be offered  a local anaesthetic injection.    The midwife or maternity support  worker will help you to wash and  freshen up, before leaving the  labour ward to go home or to the  postnatal area.  96  Forceps Forceps are smooth metal  instruments that look like large  spoons or tongs. They are curved   to ﬁt around the baby’s head.   The forceps are carefully positioned  around your baby’s head and joined  together at the handles. With a  contraction and your pushing, an  obstetrician gently pulls to help  deliver your baby.  There are many different types  of forceps. Some forceps are  speciﬁcally designed to turn the  baby to the right position to be  born, for example if your baby   is ‘back to your back’.   Forceps can leave small marks  on your baby’s face. These will  disappear quite quickly.  Afterwards You will sometimes be ﬁtted with a  catheter (a small tube that ﬁts into  your bladder) for up to 24 hours.  You are more likely to need this if  you have had an epidural, as you  may not have full feeling back.  As the baby is being born, a cut  (episiotomy) may be needed to  enlarge the vaginal opening.   Any tear or cut will be repaired   with stitches.   Depending on the circumstances,  your baby can be delivered onto your  abdomen and your birthing partner  may still be able to cut the cord,   if they want to.  Ventouse A ventouse (vacuum extractor)  is an instrument that has a  soft or hard plastic or metal  cup which is attached to your  baby’s head by a tube that is  ﬁtted to a suction device. The  cup ﬁts ﬁrmly onto your baby’s  head and, with a contraction  and your pushing, the  obstetrician or midwife gently  pulls to help deliver your baby.  The suction cup (ventouse)  can leave a small mark on your  baby’s head called a chignon  and it may also cause a bruise  on your baby’s head called a  cephalhaematoma. A ventouse  is not used if your baby is less  than 34 weeks old, because  the head is too soft.  A ventouse is less likely to cause  vaginal tearing than forceps.  Induction Labour can be induced if your   baby is overdue or there is any   sort of risk to you or your baby’s  health – for example, if you have  high blood pressure or if your  baby is failing to grow and thrive.  Induction is always planned in  advance, so you will be able to talk  over the beneﬁts and disadvantages  with your doctor and midwife and  ﬁnd out why they recommend   your labour is induced.  Contractions are usually started  by inserting a pessary or gel into  the vagina, and sometimes both  are used. Induction of labour may  take a while, particularly if the neck  of the uterus (the cervix) needs  to be softened with pessaries or  gels. Sometimes a hormone drip  is needed to speed up the labour.  Once labour starts it should proceed  normally, but it can sometimes take  24–48 hours to get you into labour. Assisted birth (forceps  or ventouse delivery) About one in eight women have an  assisted birth, where forceps or a  ventouse are used to help the baby  out of the vagina. This can be because:  • your baby is distressed • your baby is in an awkward   position  • you are too exhausted.  Both ventouse and forceps are  safe and are used only when  necessary for you and your baby.  A paediatrician may be present to  check your baby’s health. A local  anaesthetic will usually be given to  numb the birth canal if you have  not already had an epidural or spinal  anaesthetic. If your obstetrician   has any concerns, you may be  moved to a theatre so that a  caesarean section can be carried   out if needed.   8  L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  97  Caesarean section There are situations where the   safest option for you or your baby   is to have a caesarean section.   As a caesarean section involves  major surgery, it will only be  performed where there is a real  clinical need for this type of delivery.   Your baby is delivered by cutting  through your abdomen and then  into your uterus. The cut is made  across your abdomen, just below  your bikini line. The scar is usually  hidden in your pubic hair.   The operation In the UK, most caesarean sections  are performed under epidural or  spinal anaesthesia, which minimises  risk and means that you are awake  for the delivery of your baby (see  page 89). A general anaesthetic is  sometimes used – particularly   if the baby needs to be delivered  very quickly.   If you have an epidural or spinal  anaesthesia, you will not feel pain  – just some tugging and pulling as  your baby is delivered. A screen will  be put up so that you cannot see  what is being done. The doctors will  talk to you and let you know what  is happening.  If you are expecting twins, triplets  or more, it is more likely that you  will be advised to have a caesarean  section. This will depend on how  your pregnancy progresses, the  position of your babies and whether  the babies share a placenta.  Whenever a caesarean is suggested,  your doctor will explain why it  is advised and any possible side  effects. Do not hesitate to   ask questions.  Urgent (emergency)  caesareans Urgent (emergency) caesarean  sections are necessary when  complications develop and delivery  needs to be quick. This may be  before or during labour. If your  midwife and doctor are concerned  about your or your baby’s safety,  they will suggest that you have a  caesarean straight away. Sometimes  your doctor or midwife may suggest  an emergency caesarean if your  cervix does not dilate fully during  labour.   Planned (elective) caesareans A caesarean is ‘elective’ if it is planned in advance. This usually  happens because your doctor or midwife thinks that labour will   be dangerous for you or your baby.   98  Once a caesarean  always a caesarean?   If you have your ﬁrst baby by  caesarean section, this does  not necessarily mean that any  future baby will have to be  delivered in this way. Vaginal  birth after a previous caesarean  can and does happen. This will  depend on your own particular  circumstances (see page 155).  Discuss your hopes and plans  for any other deliveries with  your doctor or midwife.  Help and support  Contact the Caesarean  Support Network for  information and support   (see page 182).  Depending on the help you have at  home, you should be ready to leave  hospital within two to four days.  You will be encouraged to become  mobile as soon as possible, and your  midwife or hospital physiotherapist  will give you advice about postnatal  exercises that will help you in your  recovery. As soon as you can move  without pain, you can drive – as  long as you are able to make an  emergency stop. This may be six  weeks or sooner.   ﬁrst moments together  It takes about 5–10 minutes to  deliver the baby and the whole  operation takes about 40–50  minutes. One advantage of an  epidural or spinal anaesthetic is   that you are awake at the moment  of delivery and can see and hold  your baby immediately. Your birth  partner can be with you.  After a caesarean section After a caesarean section, you  will be uncomfortable and will be  offered painkillers. You will usually  be ﬁtted with a catheter (a small  tube that ﬁts into your bladder) for  up to 24 hours and you may be  prescribed daily injections to prevent  blood clots (thrombosis).  8  L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  99  Breech birth If your baby is breech, it means  that it is positioned with its bottom  downwards. This makes delivery  more complicated. Your obstetrician  and midwife will talk to you about  the best and safest way for your  breech baby to be born. You will   be advised to have your baby   in hospital.  External cephalic version You will usually be offered the  option of an external cephalic  version (ECV). This is when pressure  is put on your abdomen to try   to turn the baby to a head   down position.  Caesarean section If an ECV doesn’t work, you will  probably be offered a caesarean  section. This is the safest delivery  method for breech babies but there  is a slightly higher risk for you.   See the section on caesarean  sections for more information   (see pages 98–99).  If you choose a caesarean delivery  and then go into labour before the  operation, your obstetrician will  assess whether to proceed with   an emergency caesarean delivery.   If the baby is close to being born,  it may be safer for you to have   a vaginal breech birth.  100  If the second baby is in a good  position to be born, the waters  surrounding the baby will be broken,  and the second baby should be born  very soon after the ﬁrst because   the cervix is already fully dilated.   If contractions stop after the ﬁrst  birth, hormones will be added to   the drip to restart them.  Triplets or more are almost   always delivered by elective  caesarean section.   Help and support  Contact the Multiple  Births Foundation (MBF) or  Twins and Multiple Births  Association (Tamba) for  advice and support   (see pages 183 and 188).   TWINS, TRIPLETS  OR MORE If you are expecting twins, labour  may start early because of the  increased size of the uterus.   It is unusual for multiple pregnancies  to go beyond 38 weeks. More  health professionals will usually be  present at the birth. For example,  there may be a midwife, an  obstetrician and two paediatricians  (one for each baby).  The process of labour is the same  but the babies will be closely  monitored. To do this, an electronic  monitor and a scalp clip might be  ﬁtted on the ﬁrst baby once the  waters have broken (see page 87).  You will be given a drip in case it  is needed later, and an epidural is  usually recommended. Once the ﬁrst  baby has been born, the midwife   baby has been born, the midwife  or doctor will check the position  or doctor will check the position  of the second by feeling   of the second by feeling  your abdomen and doing   your abdomen and doing  a vaginal examination.  a vaginal examination.   WHAT YOUR BIRTH PARTNER CAN DO  8  Whoever your birth partner is – your partner, your baby’s father, a close  friend or a relative – there are quite a few practical things that he or she can  do to help you. The most important thing will probably be just being with  you. Beforehand you should talk about what you want, and what you  don’t want, so that they can support your decisions. There is no way   of knowing what your labour is going to be like or how each of you  will cope, but there are many ways in which a partner can help.   •  Help you to make it clear to  the midwife or doctor what  you need – and the other way  round. This can help you to   feel much more in control   of the situation.   • Tell you what is happening  as your baby is born if you   cannot see what is going on   for yourself.  For many couples, being  together during labour and  welcoming their baby together  is an experience that they  cannot begin to put into words.   And many fathers who have  seen their baby born and who  have played a part themselves  say they feel much closer to   the child from the very start.   They can:  •  Keep you company and help   to pass the time in the   early stages.   •  Hold your hand, wipe your   face, give you  sips of water,   massage your  back and  shoulders, help  you move about   or change  position, or  anything else   that helps.   • Comfort you as   your labour progresses and your  contractions get stronger.   •  Remind you how to use  relaxation and breathing  techniques, perhaps breathing  with you if it helps.   •  Support your decisions, for  example about pain relief.   L A B O U R A N D B        I  R T H  101  FEEDING  YOUR BABY  Breastfeeding  Formula feeding   103 115  It’s never too early to start thinking about how you are going to feed your baby.  Breastfeeding gives your baby the best possible start in life as it has lots of beneﬁts for  both you and your baby that last a lifetime. Discuss it with your partner as their help is  important. You both might like to watch the Bump to Breastfeeding DVD to see what  feeding your baby might be like. If you have not received a copy of the DVD, ask your  midwife for one.   • Your breastmilk is the only food   designed for your baby. It contains  everything your baby needs for  around the ﬁrst six months of life.   After that, giving your baby  breastmilk alongside solid food  will help them continue to grow  and develop. The World Health  Organization recommends  breastfeeding for two years   or longer.   • Breastfeeding protects your   baby from infections and   diseases. It also offers health  beneﬁts for mums. Every day  makes a difference to your baby,  and the longer you breastfeed,   the longer the protection lasts.   And it reduces your chance of  getting some illnesses later in life.  Formula milk cannot give your  baby the same ingredients or  provide the same protection.  • Breastfeeding helps build a strong  bond between mother and baby,  both physically and emotionally.   • Breastfeeding reduces the risk   of cot death.   102  What does breastfeeding  help protect against?  Your baby: Ear infections Asthma   Eczema  Chest infections  Obesity Gastro-  intestinal  infections Childhood  diabetes Urine   infections  Help and support  You:  Breast cancer  Weak bones  later in life Ovarian  cancer Women who  breastfeed  get their  ﬁgures   back faster  Midwives, health visitors and trained volunteers – or peer supporters  – can all offer advice and practical help with breastfeeding. Peer  supporters are mothers who have breastfed their own babies and have  had special training to help them support other mothers. Talk to your  midwife or health visitor about the help that is available in your area.   needs. Around days two to four, you  may notice that your breasts become  fuller and warmer.   This is often referred to as your milk  ‘coming in’. To keep yourself as  comfortable as possible, feed   your baby as often as they want.  Your milk will vary according to   your baby’s needs. It will look quite  thin compared with colostrum, but   gets creamier as the feed goes on.  Let your baby decide when they  have had enough.   Sometimes, breastmilk may leak  from your breast – try gentle but  ﬁrm hand pressure on your nipple  whenever this happens.   This usually helps very quickly.   If you decide to buy breast pads,   it is necessary to change them   at each feed. Plastic-backed ones  can make you even soggier.  ‘Liquid gold’: the  perfect food for your  newborn  Colostrum is sometimes   called ‘liquid gold’. This   extra-special breastmilk is full  of germ-ﬁghting antibodies  that will help protect your baby  against infections that you have  had in the past. The ﬁrst few  feeds ‘coat’ your baby’s gut to  protect them from germs and  reduce the chances of them  developing allergies as they   get older.   Later on, your breastmilk will  still contain antibodies, and as  you come across new infections  you will have new antibodies  in your milk. This means that if  you get colds or ﬂu while you  are breastfeeding, your baby  will automatically get some  immunity from those illnesses.   BREASTFEEDING Just like any new skill, breastfeeding  takes time and practice to work.  In the ﬁrst few days, you and your  baby will be getting to know each  other. Close contact and holding  your baby against your skin can  really help with this.   The more time you spend with  your baby, the quicker you will  learn to understand each other’s  signs and signals. The next few  pages will help you to understand  how breastfeeding works. And  remember, it’s OK to ask for help. Immediately after   your baby is born  Every pregnant woman has milk  ready for her baby at birth. This  milk is called colostrum and it is  sometimes quite yellow in colour.   It is very concentrated, so your   baby only needs a small amount   at each feed, which might be quite  frequent. It is full of antibodies   to boost your baby’s ability to   ﬁght off infection.   Holding your baby against your skin  straight after birth will calm them,  steady their breathing and keep  them warm. It will also encourage  them to breastfeed. Babies are often  very alert in the ﬁrst hour after birth  and keen to feed. Your midwife can  help you with this.  The ﬁrst few days  Each time your baby feeds, they are  letting your body know how much  milk it needs to produce. The amount  of milk you make will increase or  decrease in line with your baby’s   9  I  F E E D N G Y O U R        B A B Y  103  In the beginning, it can seem that  you are doing nothing but feeding,  but gradually your baby will get  into a pattern of feeding and the  amount of milk you produce will  settle. Your baby will be happier if  you keep them near you and feed  them whenever they are hungry.  This will quickly help your body to  produce the amount of milk your  baby needs. At night, your baby  will be safest sleeping in a cot in the  same room as you. This will make  feeding easier and will reduce the  risk of cot death. Try to take each  day as it comes. If you are very  uncomfortable or sore, ask for help.  First steps: starting   to breastfeed  You can breastfeed in a number   of different positions. Finding one   that is comfortable for both of   you will help your baby feed as   well as possible.    If you are lying back in a well  supported position with your   baby lying on your tummy, they   will often move themselves onto  your breast and begin to feed.  Remember at all times to keep   your baby safe.   You can try feeding lying on your  side or in a chair, supported in an  upright position. This will make it  easier to hold your baby so their  neck, shoulders and back are  supported and they can reach your  breast easily. Their head and body  should be in a straight line.   1Hold your baby’s whole body close with   the nose level with your nipple.  2Let your baby’s head tip back a little so   that their top lip can brush against your  nipple. This should help your baby to  make a wide open mouth.  Partners and breastfeeding  As a partner, you can bond with your baby in lots of different   ways, like bathing, changing nappies and carrying your baby   in a sling close to you. You can also help by bringing your baby   to their mother when it’s time for a feed. Some parents worry   that breastfeeding will make it harder for their partner to bond   with the baby. But this doesn’t have to be the case.  3When your baby’s mouth opens wide, the   chin is able to touch the breast ﬁrst, with  the head tipped back so that the tongue  can reach as much breast as possible.  You have an important role to play   in supporting your partner, for example  by preparing meals or providing   extra help so she can get some rest.  You can do small, practical things like  making sure she has a cool drink to  hand while she is feeding, and later  you can even give some feeds yourself,  using expressed milk.   104  4With the chin ﬁrmly touching, and with the   nose clear, the mouth is wide open, and  there will be much more of the darker skin  visible above your baby’s top lip than below  their bottom lip – and their cheeks will look  full and rounded as your baby feeds.  Your baby’s sucking causes milk  stored in your breasts to be  squeezed down ducts inside your  breasts towards your nipples. This  is called the ‘let-down’ reﬂex. Some  women get a tingling feeling which  can be quite strong, while others  feel nothing at all. You will see your  baby respond and their quick sucks  change to deep rhythmic swallows  as the milk begins to ﬂow. Babies  often pause after the initial quick  sucks while they wait for more  milk to be ‘delivered’. If your baby  falls asleep quickly before the deep  swallowing stage, check that they  are properly latched on. It might be  easier to get someone else to check  for you. Sometimes you will notice  your milk ﬂowing in response to  your baby crying or when you have  a warm bath.  How do I know that  my baby is feeding  well?   •  Your baby has a large   mouthful of breast.   •  Your baby’s chin is ﬁrmly   touching your breast.   •  It doesn’t hurt you to feed   (although the ﬁrst few sucks  may feel strong).   •  If you can see the dark skin   around your nipple, you  should see more dark skin  above your baby’s top lip  than below their bottom lip.   •  Your baby’s cheeks stay  rounded during sucking.   •  Your baby rhythmically takes   long sucks and swallows  (it’s normal for your baby to  pause from time to time).   •  Your baby ﬁnishes the feed   and comes off the breast   and comes off the breast  on their own.  on their own.   If you have any concerns about any  of these points, talk to your peer  supporter, midwife, GP or health  visitor, or contact the National  Breastfeeding Helpline on   0300 100 0212.   Note that if your baby seems  unusually sleepy and/or is slow to  start feeding, they may be ill, so  contact your GP as soon as possible.   Helpful tips  Breastfeeding should  feel comfortable. Your  baby should be relaxed.  You should hear a soft  swallowing. If it doesn’t  feel right, start again.  Slide one of your ﬁngers  into your baby’s mouth,  gently break the suction  and try again.   After your baby has ﬁnished  feeding, you can hold them upright  feeding, you can hold them upright  on your shoulder to wind them –  that is, until they burp.

Wet  nappies should then start to  become more frequent, with  at least six every 24 hours  from day ﬁve onwards.   • Most babies lose weight  initially. They should be  weighed by a health  professional some time  around day three to ﬁve.   From then on, they should  start to gain weight. Most  babies regain their birth  weight in the ﬁrst two weeks.   • At the beginning, your  baby will pass a black   tar-like stool (poo) called  meconium. By day three,   this should be changing   to a lighter, runnier,   greenish stool that is   easier to clean up.   From day four and for   the ﬁrst few weeks,  your baby should pass   at least two yellow   stools every day. These  stools should be at least  the size of a £2 coin.  Remember, it’s normal   for breastfed babies to   pass loose stools.  • Your breasts and nipples   should not be sore. If they  are, do ask for help.   • Your baby will be   content and satisﬁed   after most feeds and   will come off the breast  on their own.  If you are concerned  about any of these points,  speak to your midwife or  health visitor.  106  Tips for breastfeeding  • Make sure your baby is well   attached to your breast (see pictures  on page 104). This will help your  body make the right amount of  milk and stop your breasts getting  sore. The more you breastfeed  your baby, the more milk you will  produce. When your baby comes  off the ﬁrst breast, offer the  second. It doesn’t matter if they  are not interested or don’t feed  for long, or even if they feed for  longer on the second breast. This  is ﬁne – just start with this breast  next time. Sometimes your baby  might seem hungrier than usual  and feed for longer or  more often. Your body  responds automatically  and makes more milk  to provide the extra  needed. This is why you  can feed more than one  baby at the same time  (see next page).  •  There is no need to    offer formula milk in     addition to breastmilk.     If your baby feels      hungrier, feed more     often, rather than     offer formula milk. •  After a while, you will    get to know the signs     that mean your baby     is ready to feed. Most     babies will signal that     they are hungry by     opening and closing     their mouths, making     sucking noises,     opening their eyes or     turning their heads to     bring their mouths     towards you.     By the time a newborn baby starts   crying, they will normally have  been hungry for a while.   • Try not to give your baby any  other food or drink before the  age of about six months. This will  reduce your milk supply and could  increase the chance of your baby  getting ill.   • Try not to give your baby a dummy   until breastfeeding is going   well, as this can also reduce your  milk supply.   • When you are out and about,   wear something that will make it  easier for you to breastfeed.  to ask  don’t forget for help if you need it!  Dummies  Try not to give your baby a  dummy until breastfeeding is  established, usually when your  baby is a month old. Using  dummies has been shown  to reduce the amount of  milk that is produced. If your  baby becomes accustomed  to using a dummy while  sleeping, it should not be  stopped suddenly in the ﬁrst  six months. But you should  stop using a dummy when  your baby is between six and  12 months old.  Colour guide   for a baby’s   stools for   the ﬁrst   few days  Day 1  Day 2–3  Day 4  Breastfeeding more  than one baby Twins, triplets or more can be  breastfed. Because multiple  babies are more likely to be born  prematurely and to have a low  birth weight, breastmilk is especially  important for their well-being.   To start with, you may ﬁnd it  easier to feed each of your babies  separately, until you feel conﬁdent  about handling them at the same  time and feeding is well established.  This may take some time, so it can  be really helpful to accept any offers  of help around the house from  family and friends.   Over time, you will learn what  works best for you and your babies.   Triplets can be breastfed either  two together and then one  after, or all three rotated at each  feed. Alternatively, you can use a  combination of breast and formula,  depending on the babies and your  milk supply.   How long should  I breastfeed? Exclusive breastfeeding (with  no other food or drink) is  recommended for around the ﬁrst  six months of a baby’s life. After  this, you can carry on giving your  baby breastmilk alongside other  foods for as long as you and your  baby want. This can be into the  second year or beyond.   Every day you breastfeed makes   a difference to you and your baby.  There is no need to decide at  the beginning how long you will  breastfeed. Many mothers continue  to breastfeed if or when they return  to work or college. The practicalities  will depend on how old your baby   is and how many feeds they need  while you are apart, but it’s often  easier to manage than people  think. Your peer supporter, midwife,  health visitor, local support group or  the National Breastfeeding Helpline  (0300 100 0212) can explain the  options and talk them through  with you.   If you stop breastfeeding, it can  be difﬁcult to start again. Giving  formula milk to a breastfed   baby can reduce your supply   of breastmilk.   positive  feeding  More information  The Equality Bill  9  The Equality Bill offers mothers  stronger protection when  breastfeeding.

You may  want to express milk if your breasts  are feeling uncomfortably full,   or if your baby is not sucking   well but you still want to give   them breastmilk.   If you have to be away from your  baby – for example, because your  baby is ill or premature, or because  you are going back to work – you  may wish to express milk so that  somebody else can feed your baby.   You can express milk by hand or  with a breast pump. Different  pumps suit different women, so ask  for information to compare them.   A pump needs to be clean and  sterilised each time it is used.    Expressing by hand  It is more effective to express milk  by hand than to use a pump in the  ﬁrst few days. If you want to collect  the milk, you will need a sterilised  container. The following suggestions  should help:    1  Before you start, wash your   hands thoroughly then gently  massage your breast.    2  Cup your breast and feel back  from the end of the nipple to  where the texture of your breast  feels different.   108  STEP 2  Expressing milk if your  baby is premature or ill  It is important to start expressing  your milk as soon as possible  after your baby is born. To ensure  that you produce plenty of milk,  you will need to express at least  six to eight times in 24 hours,  including during the night, just as  your baby might be doing if they  were able to feed directly. Ask the  hospital staff about having skin- to-skin contact with your baby as  soon as possible after the birth.  This will help with bonding and  keeping up your milk supply.   3  Using your thumb and the rest of  your ﬁngers in a C shape, squeeze  gently about 3 to 6cm behind the  nipple – this should not hurt.   STEP 3  4  Release the pressure then repeat,   building up a rhythm. Avoid  sliding your ﬁngers over the skin.  At ﬁrst, only drops will appear,   but just keep going as it will   help build up your supply.   With practice, and a little time,  milk will ﬂow freely.  STEP 4  5  When no more drops are   coming, move your ﬁngers round  to try a different section of your  breast and repeat.     6  When the ﬂow slows down,   swap to the other breast. Keep  changing breasts until the milk  is dripping very slowly or stops  altogether.   7   If the milk doesn’t ﬂow, try  moving your ﬁngers slightly  towards the nipple or further  away, and try giving your breast   a gentle massage.   Hospitals often have machines  for expressing milk, and will  show you how to use one.  Alternatively, you can hire an  electric breast pump. Contact  breastfeeding organisations   or pump companies directly to  ﬁnd out about pump hire in   your area (see page 114 for  contact details).   If you are freezing breastmilk  because your baby is premature  or ill, ask the staff caring for your  baby for support and information.  Also see opposite for guidance   on storing breastmilk.  Your midwife, health visitor or  peer supporter can give you  practical help and answer any  questions.   Cup feeding Sometimes, your baby might   need some extra milk, or ﬁnd it   hard to feed from your breast.  In this case, your midwife might  suggest that you give your baby  some expressed milk in a cup.   Ask her to show you how. In this  way, your baby is able to taste   and begin drinking your milk.   You should not pour milk directly   into your baby’s mouth.  Storing breastmilk  You can store breastmilk for:   • up to ﬁve days in the fridge at   4ºC or lower. This means putting  the milk in the coolest part of   the fridge, usually at the back   (do not keep it in the door)  • up to two weeks in the freezer   compartment of a fridge, or  • up to six months in a domestic  freezer, at minus 18ºC or lower.  Breastmilk must always be stored  in a sterilised container. If you use  a pump, make sure you wash it  thoroughly after use and sterilise   it before use.  Milk should be defrosted   in the fridge. Once  it’s defrosted,  you will need  to use it  straight  away.   Milk that has been frozen is still  good for your baby and better than  formula milk. Milk should not be   refrozen once thawed. Don’t use   a microwave oven to warm or  defrost breastmilk. Some common  breastfeeding  problems and how   to solve them  It can be hard to ask for help,   but tackling any problems as soon  as they start will give you more   time to enjoy these early days.  In lots of cases, the solution is as  simple as changing your baby’s  position slightly or feeding them   a bit more often.   Unsettled feeding  If your baby is unsettled at the  breast and doesn’t seem satisﬁed   by feeds, it may be that they are  sucking on the nipple alone, and   so are not getting enough milk.   Ask for help to get your baby into   a better feeding position.   Sore or cracked nipples If your nipples hurt, take your   baby off the breast and start   again. If the pain continues or   your nipples start to crack or   bleed, ask for help so you get   your baby latched on comfortably   (see page 114 for information on  how to get help). It can sometimes  take a little while to sort out how  to prevent the soreness, but it  is important to get support   as soon as possible.   The following suggestions may   also help:  9  • Try squeezing out a drop or two  of your milk at the end of a feed  and gently rubbing it into your  skin. Let your nipples dry before  covering them.  • If you are using breast pads,  they need to be changed at   each feed (if possible, use pads  without a plastic backing). •(cid:0)Avoid soap as it dries your   skin out.   • Wear a cotton bra, so air can   circulate.   • Some mothers treat any cracks  or bleeding with a thin smear of  white soft parafﬁn or puriﬁed  lanolin. Put the ointment on the  crack (rather than the whole  nipple) to help it heal and prevent  a scab forming.   Tender breasts, blocked   ducts and mastitis Milk can build up in the ducts for  a variety of reasons. The most  common are wearing a too-tight  bra, missing a feed, or a blow to  the breast. It’s important that you  deal with a blocked duct as soon as  possible so that it doesn’t lead to  mastitis (inﬂammation of the breast).  If you have mastitis, your breasts will  feel hot and tender. You may see  a red patch of skin which is painful  to touch. You can feel quite ill, as if  you have ﬂu, and you may have a  temperature. This can happen very  suddenly. It is very important to carry  on breastfeeding as this will help   you get better more quickly.   If you think you might have   mastitis (or a blocked duct), try   the following:   • Take extra care to make sure  your baby is attached well to   your breast.  •(cid:0)Feed your baby more often. • Let your baby feed on the   tender breast ﬁrst.   I  F E E D N G Y O U R        B A B Y  109  • If your breasts still feel full after a  feed, or your baby cannot feed,  express your milk (see page 108  for more information on how to   do this).   • Warmth on your breast before a   feed can help milk ﬂow and make  you feel more comfortable.  • While your baby is feeding, gently   stroke the lumpy area with your  ﬁngertips towards your nipple.  This should help the milk to ﬂow.  • Get lots of rest. Go to bed if   you can.   • Take a painkiller such as   paracetamol or ibuprofen.   • Ask for help with how you get  your baby latched on properly   (see page 114 for information   on where to get help).   Mastitis may also be a sign of  infection. If there is no improvement  within 12 to 24 hours, or you start  to feel worse, contact your GP or  healthcare professional. If necessary,  they can prescribe antibiotics that  are safe to take while breastfeeding.  Thrush If you suddenly get sore, bright pink  If you suddenly get sore, bright pink  nipples after you have been feeding  nipples after you have been feeding   without problems for a while, you  might have an infection known as  thrush. Ask for help to check that  your baby is latched on properly, and  make an appointment with your GP.   You and your baby will both need  treatment. You can easily give  thrush to each other, so if your   baby has it in their mouth you  will still need some cream for  your nipples to stop it spreading  to you. You may want to ask  your pharmacist for advice. Some  antifungal creams can be bought  over the counter from a pharmacy.   Tongue-tie Some babies are born with a tight  piece of skin between the underside  of their tongue and the ﬂoor of  their mouth. This is known as  tongue-tie, and it can affect feeding  by making it hard for your baby to  attach to your breast. Tongue-tie  can be treated easily, so if you have  any concerns talk to your midwife  or health visitor or contact the   National Breastfeeding Helpline   on 0300 100 0212.

Avoid these ﬁsh altogether during  pregnancy or if you are trying to   get pregnant.  Small amounts of whatever you are  eating and drinking can pass to your  baby through your breastmilk, so  it’s a good idea to think about how  much alcohol and caffeine you are  having. These may affect your baby  in the same way they affect you.   If you think a food or foods that you  are eating are affecting your baby,  talk to your GP or health visitor, or  contact the National Breastfeeding  Helpline on 0300 100 0212.   Drinks containing caffeine can also  affect your baby and may keep  them awake, so drink them only  occasionally rather than every day  while your baby is young.   See page 112 for more information  on alcohol and breastfeeding.  Caffeine Caffeine occurs naturally in lots of  foods and drinks, including coffee,  tea and chocolate. It’s also added to  some soft drinks and energy drinks  and to some cold and ﬂu remedies.  In the early days, it is important that  you don’t have too much caffeine.  Try decaffeinated tea and coffee,  fruit juice or  water and limit  the number of  energy drinks,  which might be  high in caffeine.  Vitamins While you are breastfeeding (just  as when you were pregnant)  you should take supplements  containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of  vitamin D each day. You should be  able to get all the other vitamins  and minerals you need by eating a  varied and balanced diet.

Always  talk to your health visitor or  doctor before cutting out foods.  •(cid:0)Keep your alcohol intake low.   Alcohol in breastmilk can   affect your baby’s feeding   or sleeping. Avoid drinking  alcohol shortly before   feeding your baby.  • Avoid drinking too much   strong tea or coffee.  9  I  F E E D N G Y O U R        B A B Y  111  Peanuts  Peanuts are one of the most  common causes of food allergy.  Peanut allergy affects about   1% of people and can cause  severe reactions. Your baby may  be at higher risk of developing a  peanut allergy if you, the baby’s  father, brothers or sisters have  a food allergy or other allergic  condition such as hayfever,  asthma and/or eczema.   • If you would like to eat peanuts   or foods containing peanuts  (such as peanut butter) while  breastfeeding, you can choose  to do so as part of a healthy  balanced diet, unless you are  allergic to them or your health  professional advises you not to. • You may have heard that some   women have, in the past,  chosen not to eat peanuts while  they were breastfeeding. This  is because the government  previously advised women  that they may wish to avoid  eating peanuts while they were  breastfeeding if there was a  history of allergy in their child’s  immediate family (such as  asthma, eczema, hayfever, food  allergy or other types of allergy),  in case small amounts of peanut  in their breastmilk increased the  chance of the baby developing  a peanut allergy. But this advice  has now been changed because  the latest research has shown  that there is no clear evidence  to say that eating or not eating  peanuts while breastfeeding  has any effect on your baby’s  chances of developing a   peanut allergy.   • If you have a child under   six months and are not  breastfeeding (for example  because you are feeding your  baby on formula), then there   is no reason why you should  avoid consuming peanuts or  foods containing peanuts.   Alcohol Generally, adult women should  not regularly drink more than two  to three units of alcohol per day.  During pregnancy, women are  advised to avoid drinking. If they   do drink, they are advised to drink  no more than one to two units once  or twice a week, and are advised  not to get drunk.  By breastfeeding, you are giving  your baby the best possible start in  life. It’s very unlikely that having an  occasional drink will harm you or  your baby. However, we do know  that alcohol passes through to the  baby in very small amounts in your  breastmilk. Because of this, if you  are breastfeeding it is sensible to  limit your drinking and to keep  within the limits recommended for  pregnant women.   One unit of alcohol is approximately  equal to a single (25ml) measure   of spirits, half a pint of beer, or half   a 175ml glass of wine, although   it depends on the strength of   the drink.   The website www.nhs.uk/units  contains more information on   units, including the units found   in typical drinks.  Helpful tips  Breastfeeding and  alcohol If it’s a special occasion and  you know you are going to be  drinking, consider expressing  milk in advance. To reduce   the exposure of your baby   to alcohol:  • avoid breastfeeding for at   least two to three hours after  drinking, or  • have your drink after the last  feed of the day – if you can  predict when that will be!  If you drink alcohol and breastfeed,  it can affect your baby in a number  of ways:  • your milk may smell different and   put your baby off feeding  • the alcohol may make your baby   too sleepy to feed, or  • your baby may have difﬁculties   with digestion and problems with  their sleeping patterns.  Smoking   Smoking is bad for you, bad for  your partner and especially bad for  your baby. One of the best things  you can do for your own and your  baby’s health is to stop smoking.  Each year, more than 17,000  children under the age of ﬁve are  admitted to hospital because of  the effects of secondhand smoke.  Avoid smoking in the home or car,  and ask your partner, friends and  family to do the same when they  are around your baby.  If you do smoke and you are  ﬁnding it difﬁcult to quit,  breastfeeding will still protect  your baby from infections and  give them nutrients they cannot  get through formula milk.  Smoking after feeds, rather than  before, will help reduce your  baby’s exposure to nicotine.   You are up to four times more  likely to stop smoking successfully  with NHS support. Call the NHS  Smoking Helpline on 0800 022  4 332, or the NHS Pregnancy  Smoking Helpline on 0800 169 9  169 for information about the wide  range of free specialist support  available and for details of your  local NHS Stop Smoking Service.   You can also speak to your GP  or pharmacist about the nicotine  replacement therapy available to  help you manage your cravings  and become smokefree.  112  Medicines and  breastfeeding Many illnesses, including depression  (see page 76), can be treated while  you are breastfeeding without  harming your baby. Small amounts   of whatever medicines you take will   pass through your breastmilk to  your baby, so always tell your doctor,  dentist or pharmacist that you   are breastfeeding.   Medicines that can be taken while  breastfeeding include:  • most antibiotics • common painkillers such as  paracetamol and ibuprofen   (but not aspirin)  • hayfever medicines such as   Clarityn and Zirtek  •(cid:0)cough medicines (provided they   don’t make you drowsy)  health visitor, GP or pharmacist   if this is a concern.  9  • asthma inhalers, and  • normal doses of vitamins.

No problem is too  small – if something is worrying you,  the chances are that other mothers  will have felt the same.   You can get help from a peer  supporter, your midwife or health  visitor. You might also want to join  a local breastfeeding group. It’s a  great way of making new friends as  well as sharing the ups and downs  of looking after a new baby. Most  groups usually include a mix of  healthcare professionals and local  trained volunteer mothers (peer  supporters). These mothers have  breastfed their own babies and  have had some training in basic  breastfeeding techniques. Some  peer supporters will have had more  in-depth training to help them  support new mothers.

Small amounts  of cows’ milk can be used for  cooking after six months of age.  Condensed milk, evaporated  milk, dried milk, sheep’s milk,  goats’ milk, or any other type of  ‘milk’ drink (such as rice, oat or  almond drinks, often known as  ‘milks’) should never be given to  a baby under the age of one year.  You should not use soya formula  unless it has been prescribed by  your GP.  You can ﬁnd more information  on rice drinks at www.food. gov.uk/science/surveillance/ fsisbranch2009/survey0209  Follow-on formula is not suitable   for babies under six months.  FORMULA  FEEDING The following new advice is based  on guidance from the Department  of Health and the Food Standards  Agency. It may differ from what you  have done before if you have older  children, but to minimise any risk  it is recommended that you follow  this new advice.   Helpful tips  There are a number of  different brands of infant  formula milk available in the  shops. All should meet the  legal standards for formula  milk, and it’s up to you to  decide which one to use.  In the past it was thought  better to stick to one brand,  but there is no evidence  to suggest that changing  brands does any good or   any harm.   9  I  F E E D N G Y O U R     Choosing a formula Infant formula milk usually comes  in powder form and is based on  processed, skimmed cows’ milk,  and is treated so babies can digest  it. Vegetable oils, vitamins, minerals  and fatty acids are added to make  sure the milk contains the vitamins  and minerals that young babies  need. This information will be  on the contents list on the pack.  Infant formula powders are not  sterile, so it is important to follow  the cleaning and sterilising  instructions on page 116.  Formula is either ‘whey dominant’  or ‘casein dominant’, depending   on the balance of proteins it  contains. It may also be referred to  as stage one or stage two milk.   Whey-dominant milk is thought  to be easier to digest than casein- dominant milk, so should always be  the ﬁrst formula you give your baby.  There is little nutritional difference in  the two forms of milk, so if whey- dominant formula milk suits your  baby, they can stay on it for the ﬁrst  year or even longer.   ‘Ready-to-feed’ infant formula   milk in cartons is also available.   This is generally more expensive  than powdered milk. Once opened,  the carton should be stored in the  fridge with the cut corner turned  down. Do not store it for longer  than 24 hours.  You can continue giving your baby   infant formula when they are older  than six months.   If you have any worries  about the infant  formula milk you are  giving your baby,  ask your midwife,   health visitor or  GP for advice.  Vitamin drops  If your baby is formula fed,  you should give them vitamin  drops from the age of six  months or if they are drinking  less than 500ml of formula  a day. You can buy suitable  drops at any pharmacy.   Ask your midwife or health  visitor where you can get  vitamin drops.     B A B Y  115  Using formula   milk safely Powdered infant formula milk   must be prepared as carefully as  possible. It is not a sterile product,  and even though tins and packets  of milk powder are sealed, they  can contain bacteria such as  Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly  known as Enterobacter sakazakii)  and, more rarely, salmonella.   If the feed is not prepared safely,  these bacteria can cause infections.  Infections are very rare, but can  be life-threatening. Formula must  therefore be made up with water  hot enough to kill the bacteria – at  least 70ºC. In practice, this means  boiling the kettle and leaving it to  cool for no longer than 30 minutes.  Very young babies are at most risk,  and it is better to use sterile, liquid  ready-to-feed products for premature  or low birth weight babies. If you are  using formula, mix the formula and  water and cool quickly to feeding  temperature in cold water.  It’s also essential to make up a   fresh bottle for each feed. Throw  away unused formula within two  hours. Bacteria multiply rapidly at  room temperature and can even  survive and multiply slowly in some  fridges, so storing formula milk for  any length of time increases the risk.   Sterilising All the equipment used for feeding  your baby must be sterilised. By  sterilising your feeding equipment,  washing your hands and keeping  the preparation area clean, you will  reduce the chance of your baby  getting sickness and diarrhoea.   The following cleaning and  sterilising instructions apply whether  you are using expressed breastmilk  or infant formula milk.   1  Clean and rinse. Clean the  bottle and teat in hot soapy  water as soon as possible after a  feed, using a clean bottle brush.  Rinse all equipment in cold, clean  running water before sterilising.  2  Cold water sterilising. Follow  the manufacturer’s instructions.  Change the sterilising solution  every 24 hours, and leave  feeding equipment in the  solution for at least 30 minutes.  Make sure there is no air trapped  in the bottles or teats when  putting them in the sterilising  solution. Keep all the equipment  under the solution with a  ﬂoating cover.   3  Steam sterilising (electric  or microwave). Follow the  manufacturer’s instructions.  Make sure the openings of the  bottles and teats are facing  down in the steriliser. Any  equipment not used straight  away should be re-sterilised  before use.   careful  preparation  116  Preparing a feed  STEP 1: Before making up a feed,  clean and disinfect the surface   you are going to use. Wash your  hands carefully. If you are using a  cold water steriliser, shake off any  excess solution from the bottle and  the teat or rinse the bottle with  cooled boiled water from the kettle  (not the tap). Stand the bottle on a  clean surface. Keep the teat and cap  on the upturned lid of the steriliser.  Don’t put them on the work surface.   STEP 2          STEP 2: Use fresh tap water to ﬁll  the kettle. After it has boiled, let  the water cool for no more than  30 minutes. Don’t use artiﬁcially  softened water or water that has  already been boiled. If you have   to use bottled water, you will still   need to boil it. The water must   still be hot, otherwise any bacteria  in the milk powder might not   be destroyed.   For information about using bottled  water, go to www.eatwell.gov.uk  Always put the partially cooled  boiled water in the bottle ﬁrst.   Be careful – at 70°C, water is still  hot enough to scald. Always check  that the water level is correct.  Failure to follow the manufacturer’s  instructions may make your baby ill.   STEP 3  STEP 4  STEP 5  9  I  F E E D N G Y O U R     STEP 3: Loosely ﬁll the scoop  with milk powder and level it   off using the ﬂat edge of a   clean, dry knife or the leveller  provided. Do not pat it down.   STEP 4: Add the milk powder to the  water. Repeat, until you have added  the number of scoops speciﬁed in  the manufacturer’s instructions.   It is important to use only the scoop  that is enclosed with that milk  powder. Using too much powder can  give your baby constipation and lead  to dehydration; too little could mean  that your baby is not getting the  nutrients they need. Don’t add sugar  or cereals to the feed in the bottle.  STEP 5: Holding the edge of  the teat, put it on the bottle.   Screw the retaining ring onto   the bottle. Cover the teat with   a cap. Shake the bottle until   the powder dissolves.   Make sure you make up a fresh  bottle each time you feed your   baby and throw away unused  feed after two hours. Using stored  formula milk can increase the  chance of your baby becoming ill.   Feeding your baby Always cool your baby’s milk down  before feeding. At 70°C, it is still  hot enough to scald. To cool it, hold  the bottle, with the cap covering  the teat, under cold running water.  Test the temperature of the feed by  dropping a little onto the inside of  your wrist. It should just feel warm  to the touch, not hot.   If the milk is too cool, and your baby   doesn’t like it that way, you can  warm it up a little by putting the   bottle upright in some hot water,  keeping the teat out of the water.  Never warm milk in a microwave  oven. It will continue to heat up for  a time after you take it out of the  microwave, even though the outside  of the bottle may feel cold.   The milk inside may be very hot   and could scald your baby’s mouth.  You should check regularly that  teats are not torn or damaged.   Get everything you need ready  before you start feeding. Find a  comfortable position to hold your  baby while you are feeding. You  may need to give your baby time.  Some babies take some milk,   pause for a nap, and then wake   up for more. So you might have   to be patient. Remember, feeding   is an opportunity to feel close to  your baby and get to know them.   Even when your baby is a little   older, they should never be left  alone to feed with a propped-up  bottle, as they may choke.   When feeding, make sure you keep  the teat full of milk, otherwise your  baby will take in air and get wind.  If the teat becomes ﬂattened while  you are feeding, pull gently on the  corner of your baby’s mouth to  release the vacuum. If the teat gets  blocked, replace it with another  sterile teat.   Help and support  If you want help or advice on  formula feeding, talk to your  midwife or health visitor. See   the list of useful organisations   at the back of this book.      B A B Y  117  Feeding away   from home The safest way of feeding your  baby away from home is to carry a  measured amount of milk powder  in a small clean and dry container,  a ﬂask of boiled hot water and an  empty sterilised feeding bottle.  Make up a fresh feed whenever   you need it. The water must still   be hot when you use it, otherwise  any bacteria in the milk powder  might not be destroyed. Remember  to cool the bottle under cold  running water before you use it.   Alternatively, you could use   ready-to-drink infant formula milk  when you are away from home.   If it’s not possible to make up a fresh  feed, or if you need to transport a  feed – for example to a nursery or  childminder – you should prepare   the feed at home and cool it in the  back of the fridge for at least one  hour. Take it out of the  fridge just before you  leave, and carry it in  a cool bag with an   ice pack and   use it within   four hours.   At the end of the feed, sit and   hold your baby upright and gently  rub or pat their back for a while   to bring up any wind. There is no  need to overdo it – wind is not as  big a problem as many people think.  Talk to your baby as you rub or pat.  This will help them feel closer to you  and get them used to listening to  your voice. Don’t forget to throw  away any milk that is not used   within two hours.   Most babies gradually settle into   a pattern. Babies vary in how   often they want to feed and how  much milk they want to take.   Feed your baby when they are  hungry, just as you would if you  were breastfeeding, and don’t try  to force your baby to ﬁnish a bottle.  They may have had enough for the  time being or just want a rest.   andout about  Bottles and teats  You might ﬁnd it useful to have  about six bottles and teats, so  you can always have at least one  or two bottles clean, sterilised  and ready for use. Ask your  midwife or health visitor for  more information.  You should always buy new  teats. They come in different  shapes and with different hole  sizes, and you may have to try  several before you ﬁnd the one  that suits your baby. If the hole  is too small, your baby will not  get enough milk. If it’s too big,  the milk will come too fast.   It’s best if you can buy new  bottles too. Check regularly to  make sure the bottles are in  good condition. If they are badly  scratched, you will not be able to  sterilise them properly. If in doubt,  ask your midwife or health visitor  for more information.   Bottled water  Bottled water is not a healthier  choice than tap water and  usually is not sterile. In fact,   some natural mineral waters are  not suitable for babies because  of the amount of minerals they  contain. If you need to use  bottled water, remember that  any bottled water that is labelled  ‘natural mineral water’ might  contain too much sodium   for babies.  If you are giving bottled water  to babies under six months,   you should boil and cool it just  like tap water. If you need to   use bottled water to make up  infant formula (for babies of  any age), you should boil it and  allow it to cool for no more   than half an hour.   118  If you reach your destination   within four hours, take it out of   the cool bag and store it at the   back of a fridge for a maximum   of 24 hours. Re-warm for no   more than 15 minutes.   Helpful tips  It is always safer to make up a  fresh feed whenever possible.  When this is not possible, feeds  should never be stored for  longer than 24 hours.  Coping with allergies  If you think your baby might be  allergic to formula milk, talk to   your GP. They can prescribe formula  feeds called extensively hydrolysed  protein feeds.   Some formulas are labelled as  hypoallergenic, but they are not  suitable for babies with a diagnosed  cows’ milk allergy. Talk to your GP  before using this milk. Always get  their advice before using soya-based   Some common  problems with   formula feeding  Crying and colic For information about crying and  colic, see pages 138–139.  Sickness and vomiting Some babies bring up more milk  than others during or just after a  feed. This is called ‘possetting’,  ‘regurgitation’ or ‘gastric reﬂux’.   It is not unusual for babies to   bring up quite a lot, but it can   be upsetting when it happens   and you may be worried that  something is wrong.   Constipation Always  stick to the  recommended  amount of infant  formula milk powder.  Using too much can make your  baby constipated or thirsty.  Breastfed babies don’t usually  get constipated. If your baby is  under eight weeks old and has not  passed a stool for a few days, talk  to your health visitor or GP.   Water In very hot weather, babies fed on  infant formula milk can get thirsty.  If this happens, you can give them  cool boiled tap water if they seem  unsettled between feeds. Talk to  your health visitor or GP if you  have any concerns.   Breastfed babies do not need any  water. Instead, you may notice that  they have shorter, more frequent  feeds if the weather is hotter.  As long as  your baby  is gaining  weight, there  is usually nothing  to worry about. But  if your baby is violently sick or  appears to be in pain, or you are  worried for any other reason, talk   to your health visitor or GP.   Cover your baby’s front when  feeding and have a cloth or paper  towels handy to mop up any mess.  Check too that the hole in your  baby’s teat is not too big, as giving  milk too quickly can cause sickness.  Sitting your baby upright in a baby  chair after a feed can also help.   The problem usually stops after   six months when your baby is  starting on solid foods and drinking  less milk.   If your baby brings up a lot of milk,  remember that they are likely to  be hungry again quite quickly.   Don’t force your baby to take   on more milk than they want   during a feed. Remember, every  baby is different. Some prefer   to feed little and often.   infant formulas, too. Babies who   are allergic to cows’ milk may also  be allergic to soya.   9  Babies sometimes grow out of  allergies, and you may ﬁnd that   you can introduce cows’ milk into  your baby’s diet as they get older.  Always ask your GP or health   visitor for advice before making   any changes to your baby’s diet.   I  F E E D N G Y O U R        B A B Y  119  THE  FIRST DAYS  WITH YOUR BABY  How you feel  Postnatal care  Stitches  Bleeding  Sex and contraception   120 121 122 122 122  Your body  Your baby’s health  Your baby’s appearance  What your newborn baby can do   123 124 124 126  The ﬁrst few days with your baby can be a very emotional time    for you and your partner. There is a lot to learn and do.    There is the excitement of getting to know your baby,    but you will also be tired and your body will be  recovering from labour and the birth.  Keep your baby close to you as much as you can.   Your partner should also spend time holding and  being close to your baby. They may feel a little left  out, especially if they have to leave you and the baby  in hospital and return to an empty home. They may  need support and encouragement to get involved.   The more you can both hold and cuddle your   baby, the more conﬁdent you will all feel.  holding your  baby  close  HOW YOU FEEL You may feel tired for the ﬁrst few  days, so make sure you get plenty of  rest. Even just walking and moving  about can seem like hard work.  For a lot of mothers, the excitement  and the pleasure of the new baby  far outweigh any problems. But  you can begin to feel low or rather  depressed, especially if you are very  tired or feel you cannot look after  your baby in the way you would like.  120  Giving birth is an emotional  and tiring experience and your  hormones change dramatically in  the ﬁrst few days. Some women  get the ‘baby blues’ and feel rather  weepy around three to ﬁve days  after giving birth (see page 136).   This can be worse if your labour   was difﬁcult, you are very tired  or you have other worries. Some  women worry because they don’t  love their baby immediately. It is   not always love at ﬁrst sight. You  may just need to give yourself time  – you can still care for your baby  and provide all the warmth and  security they need.  POSTNATAL CARE If you have your baby in hospital,  you may be able to return home  with your baby straight from the  labour ward or you may be moved  to a transfer lounge or a postnatal  ward where you will be with other  mothers and babies.  You should discuss your postnatal  care with your midwife during  pregnancy so you know what   to expect.  You are likely to need quite a lot of  help and advice with your ﬁrst baby.  Whether you are in hospital or at  home, the midwives are there to  guide and support you as well as   to check that you are recovering  from the birth. Don’t hesitate   to ask for help if you need it.   A midwife will be available in your  community to help you look after  yourself and your baby.  10  T H E    F I     R S T D A Y S W T H Y O U R        I     B A B Y  121  STITCHES If you have had stitches, bathe the  area often in clean warm water  to help it to heal. Have a bath or  shower with plain warm water.  Afterwards, dry yourself carefully.   In the ﬁrst few days, remember   to sit down gently and lie on your  side rather than on your back.   Pelvic ﬂoor exercises can also help  you to heal (see page 35).   If the stitches are sore and  uncomfortable, tell your midwife  as they may be able to recommend  treatment. Painkillers will also   help. If you are breastfeeding,   check with your midwife, GP   or pharmacist before you buy   over the counter products like  ibuprofen or paracetamol.   Usually stitches just dissolve by   the time the cut or tear has healed,  but sometimes they have to be  taken out.   Going to the toilet The thought of passing urine can  be a bit frightening at ﬁrst if you are  sore or cannot feel what you are  doing. Drinking lots of water dilutes  your urine, but if it is difﬁcult to pass  urine, tell your midwife.   You probably will not need to open  your bowels for a few days after the  birth, but it’s important not to let  yourself become constipated. Eat  fresh fruit, vegetables, salad and  wholemeal bread, and drink plenty  of water. Whatever it may feel like,  it’s very unlikely that you will break  the stitches or open up the cut or  tear again.  BLEEDING After the birth you will bleed from  your vagina. This will be quite   heavy at ﬁrst, which is why you  will need super-absorbent sanitary  towels. Do not use tampons until  after your postnatal check, as  they can cause infections. While  breastfeeding you may notice that  the discharge is redder or heavier.    You may also feel cramps like period  pain, known as ‘after pains’. These  are both because feeding causes the  uterus to contract.   Gradually, the discharge will  become a brownish colour and may  continue for some weeks, getting  less and less until it stops. If you ﬁnd  you are losing blood in large clots,  you should save your sanitary towels  to show the midwife as you may  need some treatment.  SEX AND  CONTRACEPTION  Soon after your baby is born, a  midwife or doctor will talk to you  about contraception. If this doesn’t  happen, ask. You can become  pregnant straight away, even if   you are breastfeeding or have not  had a period.   Make sure you are using a reliable  form of contraception before you  and your partner have sex again,  unless you want to get pregnant  (see page 135 for your different  contraceptive options). If you are  breastfeeding, you may not have  another period until you stop  feeding, or even for some weeks  or months after that. If you are  not breastfeeding, your ﬁrst period  might start as early as a month after  the birth, or it might be much later.   recovery  and  healing  122  Breastfeeding helps because  it makes the uterus contract.  Sometimes, because this is  happening, you may feel a quite  painful twinge in your abdomen   or period-type pain while you   are breastfeeding.  Your bladder It’s quite common after having a  baby to accidentally leak urine if  you laugh, cough or move suddenly.  Pelvic ﬂoor exercises (see page 35)  will help with this. If the problem  persists after three months, see   your doctor, who may refer you   to a physiotherapist. Your bowels Piles (see page 63) are very   common after delivery but they  usually disappear within a few   days. Eat plenty of fresh fruit,  vegetables, salad, brown bread   and wholegrain cereals, and drink  plenty of water. This should make  it easier and less painful when you  pass a stool. Try not to push or  strain as this will make the piles  worse. Let the midwife know   if you feel very uncomfortable.   They will be able to give you an  ointment to soothe the piles.  Helpful tips  Postnatal exercises   Postnatal exercises  (see page 133) will  help to tone up the  muscles of your pelvic  ﬂoor and abdomen.  They will also get you  moving and feeling  generally ﬁtter. You  may be able to attend  a postnatal exercise  class at your hospital.  Ask your midwife or  physiotherapist to help  you organise this.  Personal child health  record (PCHR)  You will be given a PCHR   for your baby within a few days  of their birth. This book records  important information about  your child. Take it with you  whenever you see anyone   about your child’s health   or development. This is your  record, so do add information  yourself. This could be a note   of when your child does  something for the ﬁrst time  or advice given to you by a  healthcare professional.   YOUR BODY Your body will have gone through  some major changes over the past  few days. Your breasts Many women experience changes  in the size of their breasts during  pregnancy and breastfeeding.  See Chapter 9 for more information  about this.  If you don’t intend to breastfeed  from the start, you need not do  anything. But on the third or fourth  day, your breasts may be tender  as the milk is still being produced.  Wearing a ﬁrm, supportive bra   may help. Your breasts will reduce   in size in a week or so.  Speak to your midwife if you are  very uncomfortable. Your abdomen Your abdomen will probably be   quite baggy after delivery.   Despite having delivered your   baby plus the placenta and a lot   of ﬂuid, you will still be quite a  lot bigger than you were before  pregnancy. This is partly because  your muscles have stretched.   If you eat a balanced diet and  exercise, your shape should   soon return to normal.   Rhesus negative  mothers  If your blood group is rhesus  negative and your baby’s father’s  is rhesus positive, blood samples  will be taken after the delivery   to see whether your baby is  rhesus positive. You may need  an injection to protect your   next baby from anaemia.   This should be given within   72 hours of delivery.   10  T H E    F I     R S T D A Y S W T H Y O U R        I     B A B Y  123  Although this is rare, it can   cause them to bleed dangerously  into the brain. To prevent this,  your baby should be offered  vitamin K. You will be offered   an injection of vitamin K for   your baby, as this is the most  effective way of helping to  prevent a rare bleeding   disorder (haemorrhagic   disease of the newborn).   If you prefer that your baby  doesn’t have an injection,   oral doses of vitamin K are  available. Further doses will   be necessary. Newborn hearing  screening  programme A small number of babies are  born with hearing loss. Your  baby will be given a quick  and simple test to check their  hearing. Finding out about  hearing loss early means that  babies and parents can get   the support they need. This   can help the development   of the child’s language   and social skills. See   www.hearing.screening.nhs.uk  for further information. Newborn blood   spot screening   (heel prick test) When your baby is between  ﬁve and eight days old, your  midwife will ask to take a   sample of blood from their   heel. This is used to test for   rare but potentially serious  illnesses. All babies are tested   for phenylketonuria (PKU –   a metabolic disorder), cystic  ﬁbrosis, sickle cell disorders   and congenital hypothyroidism  (CHT – low thyroid hormone).  Some babies are also tested   for MCADD, an inherited  problem with the metabolism.   YOUR BABY’S  APPEARANCE  You will probably spend the ﬁrst  few days looking at your baby.  You will notice every detail – the  colour and texture of their hair,  the shape of their hands and feet,  and the different expressions on  their face. If you notice anything  that worries you, however small,  ask your midwife. Your baby  will be examined by a midwife,  paediatrician or neonatal nurse  practitioner to make sure   everything is all right. The fontanelle On the top of your baby’s head,  near the front, is a diamond-shaped  patch where the skull bones have  not yet fused together. This is called  the fontanelle. It will probably be a  year or more before the bones close  over. You may notice the fontanelle  moving as your baby breathes.  Don’t worry about touching it or  washing the area. There is a tough  layer of membrane under the skin.

Within 72 hours of   birth, another more detailed  examination will be carried out.   You can ﬁnd more information   at www.screening.nhs.uk  Your baby will also have some   other routine health checks   and care. Cord care   (belly button) Shortly after birth, the midwife will  clamp the umbilical cord close to  your baby’s navel with a plastic clip.  They then cut the cord, leaving a  small bit of cord with the clamp  attached. The cord will take about a  week to dry out and drop off. Keep  the navel clean and dry until this  happens. If you notice any bleeding  or discharge from the navel, tell your  midwife, health visitor or doctor. Vitamin K We all need vitamin K to make our  blood clot properly so that we will  not bleed too easily. Some newborn  babies have too little vitamin K.   124  Breasts and genitals A newborn baby’s breasts can be a  little swollen and ooze some milk,  whether the baby is a boy or a girl.  Girls also sometimes bleed a bit or  have a white, cloudy discharge from  their vagina. These are a result of  hormones passing from the mother  to the baby before birth and are no  cause for concern. The genitals of  male and female newborn babies  often appear rather swollen, but  they will look in proportion to their  bodies in a few weeks. Jaundice When they are about three days   old, many babies develop mild  jaundice. This will make their skin  and the whites of their eyes look   a bit yellow. This usually fades  within 10 days or so. But more  severe jaundice may    need treatment    (see page 149).  Your baby’s skin At birth, the top layer of your  baby’s skin is very thin and easy  to damage. Over the ﬁrst month  (longer in premature babies) your  baby’s skin matures and develops   its own natural protective barrier.  Vernix (the white sticky substance  that covers your baby’s skin in the  uterus) should always be left to  absorb naturally. This is nature’s  own moisturiser and gives added  protection against infection in the  ﬁrst few days.  Premature babies’ skin is even  more delicate. Staff in a specialised  neonatal area will advise you on   skin care.  If your baby is overdue, their skin  may well be dry and cracked. This  is to be expected, as the protective  vernix has all been absorbed.  Don’t be tempted to use any  creams or lotions as they  may do more harm than  good. The top layer  of your baby’s skin  will peel off over  the next few days,  leaving perfect skin  underneath. Wash  your baby with plain  water only for at least  the ﬁrst month.  Bumps and bruises It is quite common for a newborn  baby to have some swelling and  bruises on its head, and perhaps to  have bloodshot eyes. This is just the  result of the squeezing and pushing  that is part of being born and will  soon disappear.  Birthmarks and spots Once you begin to look closely at  your baby, you will probably ﬁnd  lots of little marks and spots, mainly  on their head and face. Some  babies have larger marks. Most of  them will go away eventually. Ask  the doctor who examines your baby   if they will disappear completely.   Most common are the little pink or  red marks some people call ‘stork  marks’. These V-shaped marks on  the forehead and upper eyelids  gradually fade, though it may be  some months before they disappear  altogether. Marks on the nape of  the neck can stay for much longer,  but they will be covered by hair.  Strawberry marks are also quite  common. They are dark red and  slightly raised. They sometimes  appear a few days after birth and  gradually get bigger. They may take  a while to go away.  Spots and rashes are very common  in newborn babies and may come  and go. You should tell your doctor  or midwife immediately if you also  notice a change in your baby’s  behaviour, for example if your baby  is not feeding properly or is very  sleepy or very irritable.  getting  to knoweach other  10  T H E    F I     R S T D A Y S W T H Y O U R        I     B A B Y  125  Rubella   If you were not immune to  rubella (German measles)  when tested early in your  pregnancy, you will usually  be offered the MMR  (measles, mumps and rubella)  immunisation. You should get  this before you leave hospital,  or shortly afterwards from your  GP. If it is not offered, speak  to your doctor or midwife, as  it’s a good opportunity to get  it done. You should not get  pregnant again for one month  after the injection. For more  information about rubella, visit  www.immunisation.nhs.uk  Tests for hepatitis B  and C   All babies born to mothers  who are infected with hepatitis  B should receive a course of  immunisation to prevent them  getting hepatitis B. Your baby  will be offered immunisation  soon after birth and at one,  two and 12 months old.  Your baby should be tested  at 12 months to check that  immunisation has worked.  For more information about  hepatitis B immunisation, refer  to page 37.  If you are infected with  hepatitis C when your baby  is born, there is a small risk  that you could pass on the  infection. Your baby will be  tested at an appropriate time.  126  WHAT YOUR  NEWBORN BABY  CAN DO  There is one important skill that  your baby will not have to learn.   They are born knowing how to  suck. During the ﬁrst few days they  learn to co-ordinate their sucking  and their breathing.  Newborn babies also automatically  turn towards a nipple or teat if it is  brushed against their cheek, and  they will open their mouths if their  upper lip is stroked. They can also  grasp things (like your ﬁnger) with  either their hands or feet, and they  will make stepping movements  if they are held upright on a ﬂat  surface. Apart from sucking, these  automatic responses will go, and  your baby will begin to make  controlled movements instead.  Newborn babies can use all of their  senses. They will look at people and  things, especially if they are near,  and particularly at people’s faces.  They will enjoy gentle touch and the  sound of a soothing voice, and they  will react to bright light and noise.  Very soon they will also know their  mother’s special smell.  WHAT YOU   NEED  FOR YOUR BABY  Nappies   Bathing   Sleeping  Out and about   In the car  Feeding  Clothes    127 128 129 130  130 131 131  It can be easy to get confused about what you really need for your baby. You can always  ask your midwife or health visitor for advice on what to buy, and you may be given a  list of essentials at your antenatal classes or by your maternity service. There are some  essentials that every new mother needs, as well as extras that you might want to think  about. You may be able to borrow some items, and then pass them on later to another  mother or keep them for a second child.   More information  For information about  choosing and using  cloth nappies, visit   www.wen.org.uk, or visit   www.goreal.org.uk to ﬁnd  local suppliers.  NAPPIES  Disposable nappies Disposable nappies are convenient  to use and are available from  supermarkets and other retail outlets.  Cloth nappies Washable cloth nappies are cheaper  than disposable nappies, even when  you take into account the cost of  washing them at home or getting  them washed by a laundry service.  They are more environmentally  friendly and are easily laundered in  a 60ºC wash. You can get shaped  cloth nappies with Velcro or popper  fastenings and waterproof wraps.  For cloth nappies, you will need:  •  nappy pins for nappies without   Velcro or fasteners  •  nappy liners – either disposable   or cloth, which you can wash and  use again  •  a bucket with a lid and nappy  sterilising powder or liquid for  sterilising nappies, and  •  about four pairs of plastic   pants that are either tie-on or  elasticated. Tie-on ones will ﬁt  small babies better. Some cloth  nappies have the waterproof  wraps attached.  127  Nappy services  Nappy laundry services deliver  freshly laundered nappies to   your home and take away the   soiled ones to wash each week.   They supply everything you   need – wraps, liners and   storage bins. Nappy changing  To change nappies, you will need:  •  cotton wool. Always choose   white. Rolls are usually cheaper  than balls  •  a changing mat • baby lotion or wipes  • baby barrier cream to help   prevent nappy rash, and  •  a bag to carry all the nappy-  changing equipment when you   go out. A carrier bag will do but  you can get special bags that  include a changing mat.  Safety  The safest place to change  a nappy is on a mat on the  ﬂoor. If you use a higher  surface, keep your hand  on your baby at all times  to stop them rolling off.  See page 144 for how to  change your baby’s nappy.  128  BATHING It is a personal choice how  frequently you bathe your baby;   a wash will often be enough to  keep your baby clean and ensure  they are comfortable. A warm bath  may help your baby to sleep.  You will need:  •  a baby bath or any large,   clean bowl, such as a sink,   as long as it’s not metal.     Remember to wrap a towel    round the taps for safety   •  two towels, the softer the better.   Keep them only for your baby’s  use. There is no need for special  baby towels, unless you want them  •  unperfumed soap – although  washing your baby with just  water is ﬁne.   See page 144 for how to bathe  your baby.  whose  turn?  SLEEPING For the ﬁrst few months, you will  need a crib, a carry cot or a Moses  basket (a light, portable bassinet). Your baby needs somewhere to  sleep that is safe and warm and  not too far away from you. If you  are borrowing a crib or cot, or if  you have one that has been used  by another of your children, you  will need a new mattress. See the  section on reducing cot death on  the right.  You will also need:  •  a ﬁrm mattress that ﬁts the cot  snugly without leaving spaces  round the edges so that your  baby cannot trap their head  and suffocate  • sheets to cover the mattress.   You need at least four because  they need to be changed  often. Fitted sheets make  life easy but they are quite  expensive. You could use   pieces of old sheet  •  light blankets for warmth.  Pillows and duvets are not  safe for babies less than a  year old because of the risk of  suffocation. Duvets can also  make the baby too hot.   Baby nests and quilted sleeping  bags are not suitable for your  baby to sleep in when you are  not there because of the   danger of suffocation.  The baby on the left is sleeping in the ‘feet to foot’ position (also  see page 140). This means that the baby’s feet are right at the end of the  cot to prevent the baby wriggling under the covers and overheating.   Cot safety Your baby will spend many hours  alone in a cot, so make sure it’s safe.  •  The mattress must ﬁt snugly with  no space for your baby’s head to  get stuck.  •  The bars must be smooth and  securely ﬁxed, and the distance  between each bar should be not  less than 1 inch (25mm) and not  more than 2 ½ inches (60mm)  so that your baby’s head cannot  become trapped.  •  The cot should be sturdy. •  The moving parts should work   smoothly so that ﬁngers or  clothing cannot get trapped.  •  Cot bumpers are not   recommended as babies can  overheat or become entangled   in the fastenings.  •  Never leave anything with ties –  for example, bibs or clothes – in  the cot in case they get caught  around your baby’s neck.  •  If you are buying a new cot,  look for the British Standard   mark BS 1753.  Reducing the risk of  cot death  The Foundation for the Study  of Infant Deaths (FSiD) has  developed important key  messages for parents to help   to reduce the risk of cot death.  •  Place your baby on their back   to sleep, in a cot in a room  with you.  •  Do not smoke in pregnancy  or let anyone smoke in the  same room as your baby. •(cid:0) Do not share a bed with   your baby if you have been  drinking alcohol, if you take  drugs or if you are a smoker. •  Never sleep with your baby   on a sofa or armchair.  •  Do not let your baby get   too hot – keep your baby’s  head uncovered – and place   your baby in the ‘feet to foot’  position.  11        W H A T Y O U N E E D   F O R Y O U R        B A B Y  129  If you have a car, look for a pram  that can be dismantled easily.   Buy a pram harness at the same  time, as you will soon need it.  Carrycot on wheels. Your baby  can sleep in the carrycot for the  ﬁrst few months and the cot can  be attached to the frame to go out.  It can also be taken in a car with  appropriate restraints.  Three-in-one. This is a carrycot  and transporter (set of wheels)   that can be converted into a  pushchair when your baby  outgrows the carrycot.  Shopping trays that ﬁt under  the pushchair or pram can be very  useful when you are out.  Checks  Before buying a pushchair or  pram, check that:  •  the brakes are in good   working order  •  the handles are at the right   height for pushing, and  •  the frame is strong   enough. enough.  IN THE CAR If you have a car, you must have a  car seat. This is also called a safety  restraint. Your baby must always go  in their seat, including when you  bring them home from the hospital.

OUT AND ABOUT Spend some time looking at what  is available for getting around with  your baby. Think about what will  suit you best. You could always  ask other mothers what they have  found useful.  Baby carriers (also called slings)  carry your baby in front of you.  Most babies like being carried like  this because they are close to you  and warm. The back part of the  carrier must be high enough to  support your baby’s head. Check  that the buckles and straps that  attach the carrier to you are secure.  Older babies who can hold up their  heads and whose backs are stronger  (at about four months) can be  carried in backpacks.  Pushchairs are only suitable for  young babies if they have fully  reclining seats that let your baby  lie ﬂat. Wait until your baby can sit  up before using any other type of  pushchair. You should also consider  the weight of the pushchair if you  use public transport as you might  have to lift it onto trains or buses.  Prams give your baby a lot of space  to sit and lie comfortably, although  they take up a lot of space and are  hard to use on public transport.   130  • breast pads. You put these into   •  a shawl or blanket to wrap   your bra to prevent milk from  leaking onto your clothes.  If you are going to formula feed,   you will need:  •  six bottles with teats and caps •  sterilising equipment •  a bottle brush •  infant formula milk. Avoid buying  this too far in advance, as instant  formula milk has a ‘use by date’  formula milk has a ‘use by date’  printed on the package.

You will probably need:  •  six stretch suits for both day and  six stretch suits for both day and  night or four stretch suits and   two nighties for the night.   Use socks or bootees with the  nightie if it’s cold  •  two cardigans. They should be   wool or cotton rather than   nylon, and light rather than   heavy. Several light layers of  clothing are best for keeping   your baby warm  your baby in  •  a wool or cotton hat, mittens   and socks or bootees for going  out if the weather is cold.   It’s better to choose close-knitted  patterns for safety  •  a sun hat for going out if the   weather is hot or the sun   is bright.  Washing   Washing   baby clothes If you use a washing  machine, don’t use washing  powders with enzymes  (bio powders) or fabric  conditioner, as they may  irritate your baby’s skin.  Always rinse clothes   very thoroughly.   •  four vests  for tiny  toes  If you have a car with   air bags in the front, your   baby should not travel in   the front seat, even if they   are facing backwards,   because of the danger of  suffocation if the bag inﬂates.   To keep your baby as safe as  possible:  • Make sure the car seat is   ﬁtted correctly.   • Do not place a rear-facing infant   car seat in the front passenger  seat if your car is ﬁtted with an   air bag.  • Don’t buy a second-hand car   seat as it may have been   damaged in an accident.   • Look for United Nations ECE   Regulation number R44.03, or   a later version of this standard,   when you buy a car seat. This   is the standard for new seats.  However, if you have car seats that  conform to a British Standard or   to an earlier version of R44, you  can continue to use them.  FEEDING If you are going to breastfeed, you  will probably want:  • nursing bras that open at the   front and have adjustable straps.  Cotton is best because it allows air  to circulate. If you try on bras at  about 36–38 weeks, they should  ﬁt when you need them  11        W H A T Y O U N E E D   F O R Y O U R        B A B Y  131  THE EARLY WEEKS:  YOU  Partners  Help and support  Looking after yourself   132 133 133  Your relationships  134 The ‘baby blues’ and postnatal depression  136 136 Your postnatal check   Your ﬁrst few weeks at home can be an exciting but anxious time for parents as you get  used to caring for your new baby.  If you have been in hospital or a midwifery unit, you may feel apprehensive about   being on your own without staff on call to help you. The more you handle your baby,   the more your conﬁdence will increase. And your community midwife, health visitor and   GP are there to support you if you have any worries or problems. Ask your midwife    or health visitor for a copy of the book Birth to Five, which has advice   on looking after your child up to the age of ﬁve.   PARTNERS As the mother’s partner, you  can get involved in caring   for your baby from day one.  In the ﬁrst weeks, you can:  •  help your baby’s mother to     breastfeed by:   –   spending time with her  while the baby is feeding –   bringing your baby   to their mother when  they need feeding in   the night  –   helping to wind   your baby    –  getting specialist help and information     on breastfeeding if the mother has     any concerns  • provide emotional support and   encouragement  • make nutritious meals and snacks for   your baby’s mother  • change your baby’s nappies • bathe and dress   your baby  • cuddle and play   with your baby  • clean the house,   go shopping   and do other  household chores.     You may feel quite nervous about handling the baby at ﬁrst   but you will get more conﬁdent. Don’t be embarrassed to   ask for help or encouragement.  132  HELP AND  SUPPORT You will probably need a lot of  practical help, as well as emotional  support. You are bound to feel up  and down and to get tired easily in  the ﬁrst few weeks. Many women  want to have their partner around  so that you get to know the baby  together and have help with the  work. Being together at this time  helps you to start to adjust to the  changes in your life. If you are on  your own, or your partner cannot  be with you, ask your mother or a  close friend to be there.   Even with help, you will probably  feel tired. Here are some things you  could try:  •  Cut down on cleaning – a bit of   dust will not hurt.  •  Keep meals simple but healthy.   You need to eat well but this  need not involve a great deal of  preparation and cooking.  •  Try to space visitors out and say no   to visitors if you feel too tired or  need some time with your baby.   It’s tempting to use your baby’s  sleep times to catch up on   chores, but try to have a sleep   or a proper rest at least once   during the day. Exercise Continue with any postnatal  exercises you have been shown   by your midwife. You can also do  this deep stomach exercise when  you feel well enough.  1  Lie on your side with your   knees slightly bent.  2  Let your tummy relax and   breathe in gently.  3  As you breathe out, gently  draw in the lower part of   your stomach like a corset,  narrowing your waistline. 4  Squeeze your pelvic ﬂoor. 5  Hold for a count of 10   then gently release.  6  Repeat 10 times.  You should not move your back   at any time. After six weeks,  progress to the box position   (see page 34).  Besides these exercises, try to   ﬁt in a walk with your baby    every day. This   can help you lose  weight and feel  better.     Too many visitors in a short time   can be very tiring. If visitors do  come, don’t feel you have to tidy  up or lay on a meal. Let them do  things for you, like the washing  up, making a meal or bringing  some groceries.  •  If you need extra help, ask. Friends   or neighbours will probably be  very willing to help you by doing  things like shopping.  LOOKING AFTER  YOURSELF Although you may feel like your  every waking hour is spent caring  for your baby, it’s important to look  after yourself as well. Rest While you are feeding your baby at  night and your body is recovering  from childbirth, it is essential to  catch up on rest.   12  T H E        E A R L Y W E E K S  :    Y O U  133  YOUR  RELATIONSHIPS After you have had a baby, the  relationships around you can  change. Many women ﬁnd that  they turn to their own mother for  help and support. But your mother  may not be sure about how much  to get involved. You may ﬁnd that  she is trying to take over or that she  is so anxious not to interfere that  she doesn’t help at all. Try to let her  and others know what help and  support you want from them.  Your relationship with your partner  will also change. It is very easy in  those exhausting early weeks just  to leave things to sort themselves  out. You may wake up six months  later to ﬁnd that you have not spent  an hour alone together and have  lost the knack of easily talking your  problems through. You both need  time alone, without the baby, to  recharge your own batteries. You  also need time together, without  the baby, to keep in touch with  each other.  Your relationship with your baby  may not be easy either, particularly  if you are not getting much sleep.  Don’t feel guilty if you sometimes  feel resentful at the demands your  baby makes, or if your feelings are  not what you expected them to be.  Talk to your midwife or health   visitor if you are upset or worried.   But remember, many mothers ﬁnd  their babies difﬁcult at ﬁrst and  come to love them gradually over  some weeks.  If you are on your own and   don’t have family to support you,  ask a friend to help you in the   early weeks. Sex and contraception There are no rules about when to  start having sex again. Don’t rush  into it – if it hurts, it will not   be pleasurable. You may want   to use a lubricating jelly the ﬁrst  time because hormone changes  may make your vagina feel drier  than usual.  Eating properly It’s very important to eat properly  (see Chapter 3). If you want to lose  weight, don’t rush it. A varied diet  without too many fatty foods will  help you lose weight gradually. Try  to make time to sit down, relax and  enjoy your food so that you digest  it properly. It doesn’t have to be  complicated. Try food like baked  potatoes with baked beans and  cheese, salads, pasta, French bread  pizza, scrambled eggs or sardines on  toast, followed by fruit mixed with  yoghurt or fromage frais.  A healthy diet is especially  important if you are breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding can help mothers to  lose weight. Some of the fat you  put on in pregnancy will be used to  help produce milk, but the rest of  the nutrients will come from your  diet. This means that you may be  hungrier than usual. If you do need  a snack, try having beans on toast,  sandwiches, bowls of cereal or fruit  (see page 29).  Sure Start Children’s Centres give  advice about healthy eating plans  for mothers, as well as support for  breastfeeding. You can ﬁnd out  more about the services offered in  Children’s Centres in your area by  visiting www.surestart.gov.uk  134  have to use some other form of  contraceptive (like a condom)  as well. There is no evidence  to suggest that this pill affects  your baby in any way. Even so,  some women prefer not to take  it while they are breastfeeding  and use another form of  contraception instead.  •  The cap or diaphragm. These   can be used six weeks after  you give birth. If you had a cap  before, it probably will not be  the right size any longer. You  can have a new one ﬁtted at  your postnatal check-up.  Long-acting   contraceptive methods Long-acting contraceptive  methods last between three  months and ten years. They   may be suitable if you think   you will forget to take or use   a short-acting contraceptive.  •  The IUD (intra-uterine device)  or IUS (intra-uterine system).  These can be ﬁtted from the  fourth week after you give  birth. They can be ﬁtted at your  postnatal check-up when your  uterus is back to its normal size. • The contraceptive injection.   It is recommended that you wait  until six weeks after you give  birth before you are given this.  It can be given earlier in some  circumstances. The contraceptive  injection will not affect your milk  supply if you are breastfeeding.   • The contraceptive implant  (Implanon). This contains a  long-lasting progestogen and   is effective for three years.   It can be ﬁtted 21 days after  you give birth or earlier in some  circumstances. If it’s ﬁtted after  21 days, you will have to use  another contraceptive for seven  days. The contraceptive implant  will not affect your milk supply   if you are breastfeeding.  It might be some time before you  want to have sex. Until then, you  both may feel happier ﬁnding other  ways of being loving and close.  If you or your partner have any  worries, discuss them with your GP  or health visitor.  It is possible to get pregnant even  if you have not started your periods  again or if you are breastfeeding.  It is therefore important to use   contraceptives as  soon as you   start having   sex again.   Your midwife or  doctor should  talk to you about contraception  before you leave hospital and again  when you go for your six-week  postnatal check. Alternatively, you  could talk to your midwife or health  visitor when they visit you at home  or go to your GP or community  contraceptive clinic (sometimes  called family planning or CASH  clinic).  The FPA (Family Planning  Association – see page 184)  publishes free leaﬂets about   all methods of contraception.  Contraceptives  Short-acting   contraceptive methods Short-acting contraceptive  methods rely on you taking them  every day or when you have sex.  •  The condom. This may be   the easiest choice for the  early weeks after childbirth.  Condoms offer the best  protection against sexually  transmitted infections (STIs) so  if you think you or your partner  may have been exposed to an  STI you should use a condom in  addition to your other choice   of contraception.  •  The combined pill. If you are   not breastfeeding, you can start  taking this pill 21 days after you  give birth. If you start it later  than the 21st day, it will not be  reliable for the ﬁrst seven days.  So for this time you will have to  use another contraceptive (like a  condom) as well. Don’t take this  pill if you are breastfeeding as it  reduces milk ﬂow.  •  The progestogen-only pill.  If you are breastfeeding, you  can take a progestogen-only  pill, which will not affect your  milk supply. This can also be  started 21 days after you give  birth. It has to be taken at the  same time every day. If you  start it later than the 21st day,  it will not be reliable for two  days. So for this time you will   12       T T H H E E     E E A A R R L L Y Y W W E E E E K K S S Y Y O O U U  :   :    135  THE ‘BABY BLUES’  AND POSTNATAL  DEPRESSION As many as 8 out of 10 mothers get  the ‘baby blues’, often about three  to ﬁve days after the birth. You  might feel upset, mildly depressed,  or just keep bursting into tears for  no apparent reason. It usually only  lasts for a few days.   Around 1 in 10 mothers become  depressed. This is usually mild but  sometimes can be quite severe.  You must get help if you are taken  over by a feeling of sadness and  hopelessness, you feel irritable  and anxious, or you have difﬁculty  sleeping and coping with even the  smallest task. See page 82 for   more information.  Help and support  If you think you are depressed,  contact your GP or health  visitor and explain how you are  feeling. Your partner or a friend  could contact them for you if  you want. You can also contact  the Association for Post-Natal  Illness (see page 186) for more  information.  If you have twins or triplets,   you are more likely to experience  postnatal and longer-term  depression. This is mainly because  of the additional stress of caring  for more than one baby. Just  getting out of the house can be  difﬁcult when you have more  than one baby, and this can make  you feel isolated. Tamba (see page  188) can help you make contact  with other mothers of multiples  via local twins clubs and through  their helpline – Tamba Twinline on  0880 138 0509 – where you can  talk to other mothers of multiples. You may also ﬁnd it helpful  to contact the Multiple Births  Foundation (see page 183).   136  Tell the doctor if the examination   is uncomfortable.  • Your breasts are unlikely to be   examined unless you have a  particular concern.  • A cervical smear test may be   discussed if you have not had one  in the past three years (see page  48). This is usually delayed until  three months after delivery.  • If you are not immune to rubella  (German measles) and were not  given an immunisation before you  left hospital, you will be offered  one now. You should not become  pregnant for one month after this  immunisation.  • You will be asked if you still have   any vaginal discharge and whether  you have had a period yet.  •  Tell your doctor if:  -  you are having trouble holding   in urine or wind, or you are  soiling yourself  -  intercourse is painful -  you are feeling very tired,   low or depressed, or  -  you are worried about anything. You can also ask your doctor about  contraception. You may wish to  choose a different method to  the one you had previously used  (especially if your pregnancy   was not planned). The doctor or   nurse can help you decide which  method is right for you now.   See the box on page 135 for   some of the different options.   Your baby’s check  Your GP’s surgery or health  clinic will probably arrange  for your baby’s six-week  check to be done at your  postnatal check. If you go  to the hospital, the baby’s  check will usually need to   be arranged separately.     YOUR POSTNATAL  CHECK You should have your postnatal  check about six weeks after your  baby’s birth to make sure that you  feel well and are recovering from  the birth. You may be offered an  appointment to go back to the  hospital or midwifery unit where  you gave birth, but otherwise   you should see your GP. It’s time   to introduce your baby to your   GP as the new member of   your family!   It’s a good opportunity to ask  any questions and sort out any  problems that are troubling you.  You may like to make a list of  questions to take along with you   so that you don’t forget what   you want to ask.  What usually happens •  You will be weighed and can  get weight loss advice if you   need it.   •  Your urine will be tested to  make sure your kidneys are  working properly and that   there is no infection.  •  Your blood pressure will be   checked.  •  You may be offered an   examination to see if: -  your stitches (if you had any)   have healed  -  your uterus is back to its   normal size, and  -  all the muscles used during   labour and delivery are   returning to normal.

You will start to  understand them and will learn what is normal and what may be a sign that something   is wrong. But the most important thing to do in the ﬁrst few weeks is to enjoy your   baby. Spending time with them is the best way to help them feel safe and loved.  ENJOYING   YOUR BABY  Keeping your baby warm, fed and  safe may seem to take up all of your  time in the ﬁrst weeks. But they are  only a tiny part of what it means to  be a parent. Every second that your  baby is awake, they are learning  from you. Learning about what it  feels like to be touched gently, the  sound of your voice and your very  special smell.      They are learning about what the  world is like and, above all, what it  feels like to love and be loved. It is  important to talk to your baby.  listening to your voice  Talking to your baby   It is very important to talk to  your baby. If you or your family  speak another language, use  it to speak to your baby. It can  help your baby to learn other  languages, and enjoy another  culture. You can talk to them  about anything and everything.  Talking to young children, even  very young babies helps them  become good communicators  later in life. It will also help  your baby build their early  bond with you.  12  T T H H E E            E E A A R R L L Y Y W W E E E E K K S S  : :      Y Y O O U U R     B A B Y  137  CRYING All babies cry. It’s their way of  saying that something is not right.  Sometimes you will be able to ﬁnd  the reason for your baby’s distress  and deal with it. At other times  all you can do is try to comfort or  distract your baby. If it’s not obvious  why your baby is crying, think of  possible reasons.   Are they: •  hungry? •  hot, cold or uncomfortable? •  feeling tired and unable to sleep? •  lonely and wanting company? •  bored and wanting to play?  Do they have: •  a wet or dirty nappy? •  wind? •  colic?  It could be none of these things.  Perhaps your baby simply feels   overwhelmed and a   bit frightened by all  the new sights,  sounds and   sensations.   At the moment, if you are not  married, you can decide whether  you want the father’s name to  appear on the birth certiﬁcate.   If you do not want his name to  appear, you can register the birth   by yourself. However, the  government plans to change the   law so that joint registration, by both  mother and father, becomes the  normal arrangement for unmarried  parents. Your local register ofﬁce  will be able to provide detailed  information about these changes  when they come into effect.  If you live in a different district from  the one where your baby was born,  you can go to your nearest register  ofﬁce. The registrar will take details  from you and then send them to  the district where your baby was  born. You will then be sent the  birth certiﬁcate. You cannot claim  beneﬁts, such as Child Beneﬁt,   until you have a birth certiﬁcate.   All babies born in England and  Wales are now given a unique  NHS number at birth. Midwives  request and receive a newborn  baby’s NHS number. They send  this NHS number to the  Registrar of Births,   Deaths and  Marriages via  your local  child health  department.  REGISTERING   THE BIRTH Your baby’s birth must be registered  within six weeks from when they  were born. This will take place at  the register ofﬁce in the district  where they were born. The contact  details will be in the telephone  book under the name of your local  authority or you can ﬁnd it online   at www.direct.gov.uk  If you are married, you or the father  can register the birth. If you are not  married, you may register together  with your baby’s father and his name  will appear on the birth certiﬁcate.   In most circumstances, children  beneﬁt from being acknowledged  by both parents and by knowing the  identity of both their mother and  father. To register jointly, you must  either go together to register the  birth or one of you can go with an  appropriate document. Including  the father’s name in the birth  register will usually give him parental  responsibility. Your local register  ofﬁce will explain this process.       138  Getting help If you feel you are having difﬁculties  coping with your baby’s crying, talk  to your midwife or health visitor. Or  contact Cry-sis on 08451 228669 –  they will put you in touch with other  parents who have been in the same  situation. If you have twins or more,  the crying can seem relentless –  Twinline, Tamba’s helpline (see page  188), can offer support.  If your baby’s crying sounds  different or unusual, it may be the  ﬁrst sign of illness, particularly if  they are not feeding well or will  not be comforted. If you think  your baby is ill, contact your doctor  immediately. If you cannot contact  your doctor and it’s an emergency,  take your baby to the nearest  hospital accident and emergency  department.  13  T H E        E A R L Y W E E K S  :    Y O U R     B A B Y  When crying gets   too much Some babies do cry more than  others and it’s not really clear why.  Don’t blame yourself, your partner  or your baby if they cry a lot. It can  be very exhausting so try to get  rest when you can. Share soothing  your baby with your partner. You  could ask a friend or relative to take  over for an hour from time to time,  just to give you a break. If there  is no one to turn to and you feel  your patience is running out, leave  your baby in the cot and go into  another room for a few minutes.  Put on some music to drown the  noise, take some deep breaths,  make yourself a cup of tea or ﬁnd  some other way to unwind. You will  cope better if you do. If you are very  angry or upset, telephone someone  who will make you feel better.  Never shake your baby. Shaking  makes a baby’s head move violently.  It can cause bleeding and damage  the brain.   Colic If your baby has repeated episodes of excessive and inconsolable  crying but they otherwise appear to be thriving and healthy,   they may have colic.  Although it may appear that your baby is in distress, colic is not  harmful. Your baby will continue to feed and gain weight normally.  There is no evidence that colic has any long-term effects.  Colic can be very upsetting for parents. You may feel like you are letting  your baby down or that you are doing something wrong. Although  colic can be distressing at the time, it is a common phase that should  last only a few weeks at the most. It may help to remind yourself that  you are not causing the crying and it is not under your control. If you  are concerned, talk to your health visitor or GP.  139  Comforting   your baby Holding your baby close and  talking in a soothing voice or  singing softly will reassure them.  Movement often helps to calm  down crying. Gently sway or rock  your baby or take them for a walk  or for a ride in a car.   Sucking can also be comforting.  You can put your baby to your  breast or give them a dummy,   as long as breastfeeding   as long as breastfeeding  is well established   is well established  is well established  (see page  106).

They will suck anyway. Using  sugar will only encourage a  craving for sweet things, which  are bad for their teeth.     Reducing the risk    of cot death Sadly, we don’t know why some  babies die suddenly and for no  apparent reason from what is  called ‘cot death’ or ‘Sudden  Infant Death Syndrome’ (SIDS).  But we do know that placing  a baby to sleep on their back  reduces the risk, and that  exposing a baby to cigarette  smoke or overheating a baby  increases the risk.  All the advice that we now  have for reducing the risk of cot  death and other dangers, such  as suffocation, is listed on this  page and opposite. Remember  that cot death is rare, so don’t  let worrying about it stop you  enjoying your baby’s ﬁrst few  months. But do follow the advice  given here to reduce the risks as  much as possible.  To reduce the risk of cot death:  •  Place your baby on their back   to sleep, in a cot in a room  with you.  •  Do not smoke in pregnancy or  let anyone smoke in the same  room as your baby.  •  Do not share a bed with your   baby if you have been drinking  alcohol, if you take drugs or if  you are a smoker.  Place your baby on their  back to sleep Place your baby on their back to  sleep from the very beginning for  both day and night sleeps. This will  reduce the risk of cot death. Side  sleeping is not as safe as sleeping  on the back. Healthy babies placed  on their backs are not more likely  to choke. When your baby is old  enough to roll over, they should not  be prevented from doing so.  Babies may get ﬂattening of  the part of the head they lie on  (plagiocephaly). This will become  rounder again as they grow,  particularly if they are encouraged  to lie on their tummies to play  when they are awake and being  supervised. Experiencing a range of  different positions and a variety of  movement while awake is also good  for a baby’s development.  The risks of bed sharing The safest place for your baby to  sleep is in a cot in a room with you  for the ﬁrst six months. Do not  share a bed with your baby if you or  your partner:  •  are smokers (no matter where or  when you smoke and even if you  never smoke in bed)  •  have recently drunk alcohol •  have taken medication or drugs  that make you sleep more heavily  •  Never sleep with your baby on   •  feel very tired.  a sofa or armchair.  •  Do not let your baby get too  hot – keep your baby’s head  uncovered.  •  Place your baby in the ‘feet to   foot’ position.  The safest place for your   baby to sleep is on their  back in a cot in a room   with you for the ﬁrst   six months.  The risks of bed sharing are also  increased if your baby:  •  was premature (born before   37 weeks), or  •  was of low birth weight  (less than 2.5kg or 5.5lb).  There is also a risk that you might  roll over in your sleep and suffocate  your baby, or that your baby could  get caught between the wall and  the bed, or could roll out of an adult  bed and be injured.  SLEEP  The amount that babies sleep, even  when they are very small, varies a  lot. During the early weeks some  babies sleep for most of the time  between feeds. Others will be  wide awake. As they grow older,  they begin to develop a pattern of  waking and sleeping. Some babies  need more sleep than others and at  different times. Try not to compare  what your baby does with other  people’s babies. All babies are  different, and their routines will  change as they grow.  You will gradually begin to  recognise when your baby is ready  for sleep and is likely to settle. Some  babies settle better after a warm  bath. Most sleep after a good feed.   A baby who wants to sleep is not  likely to be disturbed by ordinary  household noises, so there is no  need to keep your whole home  quiet while your baby sleeps. It will  help you if your baby gets used to  sleeping through a certain amount of  noise. See the column on the right  for advice on sleeping positions.  Twins, triplets or more can have  speciﬁc sleeping issues and it may  be difﬁcult for you to get them  into a routine. The Multiple Births  Foundation and Tamba (see pages  183 and 188) have information   that you may ﬁnd useful. They can  sleep in the same cot – there is  information from Tamba on   how you can do this safely.  140  Never sleep with a baby on   a sofa or armchair It’s lovely to have your baby with  you for a cuddle or a feed but it’s  safest to put your baby back in their  cot before you go to sleep.  Cut out smoking during  pregnancy – partners too! Smoking in pregnancy greatly  increases the risk of cot death.  It is best not to smoke at all.  If you are pregnant and want   to give up, call the NHS   Pregnancy Smoking Helpline   on 0800 169 9 169.  Don’t smoke near   your baby.  Don’t let anyone smoke in  the same room as your baby Babies exposed to cigarette smoke  after birth are also at an increased  risk of cot death. Nobody should  smoke in the house, including  visitors. Anyone who needs to  smoke should go outside. Do not  take your baby into smoky places.  If you are a smoker, sharing a bed  with your baby increases the risk   of cot death.  Don’t let your baby get too  hot (or too cold) Overheating can increase the risk  of cot death. Babies can overheat  because of too much bedding or  clothing, or because the room is too  hot. Remember, a folded blanket  counts as two blankets. When you  check your baby, make sure they  are not too hot. If your baby is  sweating or their tummy feels hot  to the touch, take off some of the  bedding. Don’t worry if your baby’s  hands or feet feel cool – this   is normal.  • It is easier to adjust the   temperature with changes   of lightweight blankets.    Remember, a folded blanket  counts as two blankets.  covers, place your baby feet to foot  in the crib, cot or pram.  13  Make the covers up so that they  reach no higher than the shoulders.  Covers should be securely tucked   in so they cannot slip over your  baby’s head. Use one or more   layers of lightweight blankets.  Sleep your baby on a mattress that  is ﬁrm, ﬂat, well ﬁtting and clean.  The outside of the mattress should  be waterproof. Cover the mattress  with a single sheet.  Remember, do not use duvets,  quilts, baby nests, wedges,   bedding rolls or pillows.  Put your baby feet to foot   in the crib.  T H E        E A R L Y W E E K S  :    Y O U R     B A B Y  Feeding Breastfeeding your baby reduces the  risk of cot death. See Chapter 9 for  everything you need to know about  breastfeeding.  •  Babies do not need hot rooms;   all-night heating is rarely  necessary. Keep the room at a  temperature that is comfortable  for you at night. About 18°C  (65°F) is comfortable.  •  If it is very warm, your baby may   not need any bedclothes other  than a sheet.  •  Even in winter, most babies who   are unwell or feverish do not   need extra clothes.  •  Babies should never sleep with   a hot-water bottle or electric  blanket, next to a radiator, heater  or ﬁre, or in direct sunshine.  •  Babies lose excess heat from their   heads, so make sure their heads  cannot be covered by bedclothes  during sleep periods.  Don’t let your baby  overheat. Remove hats and extra  clothing as soon as you   come indoors or enter   a warm car, bus or train,   even if it means waking   your baby.  It is possible that using a dummy at  the start of any sleep period reduces  the risk of cot death. Do not begin  to give a dummy until breastfeeding  is well established, usually when  your baby is around one month   old. Stop giving the dummy when   your baby is between six and   12 months old.  141  Don’t let your baby’s head  become covered Babies whose heads are covered  with bedding are at an increased  risk of cot death. To prevent your  baby wriggling down under the   If your baby is unwell, seek  MEDICAL advice promptly Babies often have minor illnesses  that you do not need to worry  about.  Make sure your baby drinks plenty  of ﬂuids and is not too hot. If  your baby sleeps a lot, wake them  regularly for a drink.  It can be difﬁcult to judge whether  an illness is more serious and  requires prompt medical attention.  See the section on illnesses on  page 145 for guidance on when  you should get help.  Monitors Normal healthy babies do not need  a breathing monitor. Some parents  ﬁnd that using a breathing monitor  reassures them. However, there is  no evidence that monitors prevent  cot death. If you have any worries  about your baby, ask your doctor  about the best steps to take.  Immunisation reduces   the risk of cot death.   For more information   about immunisation, visit  www.immunisation.nhs.uk  More information  For more information on  reducing the risk of cot  death, or to buy a simple  room thermometer for  your baby, contact the  Foundation for the Study  of Infant Deaths (FSID):  Telephone: 020 7802 3200  Email: ofﬁce@fsid.org.uk  Website: www.fsid.org.uk  CHANGING   YOUR BABY Babies need their  nappies changed fairly  often, otherwise they  become sore. Unless  your baby is sleeping  peacefully, always  change a wet or dirty  nappy and change  your baby before  or after each feed.  Organise the place where  you change your baby so that  everything you need is handy (see  page 128). The best place to change   a nappy is on a changing mat or  towel on the ﬂoor, particularly if you  have more than one baby. That way,   if you take your eye off your baby   for a moment to look after another  child, your baby cannot fall and   hurt themselves.  Try to sit down, so you don’t  hurt your back. If you are using a  changing table, keep an eye on your  baby at all times.  See the next page for the different  kinds of nappies that are available. How to change a nappy You need to clean your baby’s  bottom carefully each time you  change a nappy to help prevent  soreness and nappy rash.  STEP 1 • Take off the nappy. If it’s dirty, wipe   away the mess from your baby’s  bottom with tissues or cotton wool.  • Wash your baby’s bottom and   genitals with cotton wool and warm  water and dry thoroughly. For girls,   wipe the bottom from  front to back, away  from the vagina, so that  germs will not infect  the vagina or bladder.  For boys, gently clean  the foreskin of the  penis (it can be pulled  back very gently).   142       Clean under the penis and the  scrotum. Water is ﬁne for cleaning  your baby’s bottom but you may  want to use wipes or lotion for  convenience when you are away  from home.  • You may want to use a cream, such  as zinc and castor oil cream, which  forms a waterproof coating to help  protect the skin. Or you can just leave  the skin clean and dry, especially   with disposable nappies, since cream   may prevent them absorbing urine  so well. Don’t use baby powder   as it can cause choking.  • If you are using a cloth nappy,   place it in a waterproof cover (if  needed) and put a nappy liner  inside. Lay your baby carefully on  the nappy, bring the centre of the  nappy between your baby’s legs  and then fasten the poppers or  Velcro. Check that it ﬁts snugly  around the waist and legs.  STEP 2 • If you are using a disposable   nappy, put the side with the sticky  tapes under your baby’s bottom.   STEP 3 • Fasten the tapes at the front.   Be very careful not to get cream  on the tabs or they will not stick.  • Wash your hands. Nappy hygiene Disposable nappies If the nappy is dirty, ﬂush the  contents down the toilet. Roll up  the nappy and re-tape it securely.  Put it into a plastic bag. Don’t put  anything but nappies in this bag.  Fasten the bag and put it outside   in your bin each day.  Cloth nappies •  If the nappy is dirty, ﬂush the   contents down the toilet.  Biodegradable, ﬂushable nappy  liners are available to make it easy. •  Have a lidded bucket ready to store   the dirty nappies. You can soak  them in a nappy cleanser (follow  the instructions on the packet) or  just store them here until you have  a load ready for washing.  •  Wash nappies every two to three  days. Follow the care instructions  on your nappies, but a 60ºC  wash is usually OK. If you did not  soak the nappies before, add an  antibacterial nappy cleanser to your  normal washing detergent (follow  the instructions on the packet).  Don’t use enzyme (bio) washing  powders or fabric conditioner as  these may irritate your baby’s skin –  and the conditioner may make the   nappy less absorbent. Make sure  you use the correct amount of  detergent and rinse thoroughly.   Nappy rash Most babies get a sore bottom  or have nappy rash at some time,  but some have extra-sensitive skins.  Nappy rashes are caused by contact  between sensitive skin and soiled  nappies. If you notice redness or  spots, clean your baby very carefully  and change their nappies more  frequently. Better still, give your  baby time without a nappy and  let the air get to their skin. Keep a  spare nappy handy to mop up any  accidents. You will soon see the rash  start to get better.  If your baby does have a rash, ask  your midwife or health visitor about  it. They may advise you to use a  protective cream. If the rash seems  to be painful and will not go away,  see your health visitor or GP. Babies’ poo (stools) Immediately after birth and for the  ﬁrst few days, your baby is likely  to pass a sticky, greenish-black  substance. This is called meconium  and it is the waste that has collected  in your baby’s bowels while they  were in your uterus.  As your baby begins to digest milk,  the stools will change. They will  become more yellow or orange  and can be quite bright in colour.  Breastfed babies have quite runny   Babies vary a lot   in how often they  pass stools. Some have a   bowel movement at or around each  feed; some can go for several days  without having a movement. Either  can be normal, but most breastfed  babies produce at least one stool   a day for the ﬁrst six weeks.  When to get help Most small babies strain and go  red in the face, or even cry, when  passing a stool. This is normal and  doesn’t mean they are constipated  as long as the stools are soft. If you  are worried that your baby may be  constipated, mention this to your  midwife or health visitor.  What you ﬁnd in your baby’s  nappies will probably vary from day  to day, and usually there is no need  to worry. For example, it is normal  for some babies to have very runny  stools. But ask your doctor, midwife  or health visitor if you notice any   big changes, such as stools:   • becoming very frequent and   watery  • being very smelly • changing colour to become   green, white or creamy.  See ‘Babies with jaundice after   two weeks’ on page 149.  Putting on a disposable nappy   STEP 1  STEP 2  STEP 3  stools. Formula-fed  babies’ stools   are ﬁrmer and  smell more.  13  T H E        E A R L Y W E E K S  :    Y O U R     B A B Y  143  See page 124 on keeping your   baby’s umbilical cord clean and dry. Bathing Bath your baby two or three times  a week, or more often if they enjoy  it. Don’t bath them straight after  a feed or when they are hungry or  sleepy. Make sure the room is warm  and that you have everything you  need ready in advance. 1  Check that the water is not   too hot. Test it with your wrist  or elbow. It should be just  comfortably warm.  2  Undress your baby except for  their nappy, and wrap them  snugly in a towel. Wash your  baby’s face with cotton wool and  water as described above. There  is no need to use any soap.  3  Wash your baby’s hair with baby  soap or liquid, supporting their  head over the baby bath or  basin. Rinse carefully. You don’t  need to use soap every time.  4  If you want to use soap  occasionally, use a mild,  unperfumed soap. Unwrap your  baby and soap them all over, but  keep them on your lap so you  have a ﬁrm grip. Take the nappy  off at the last minute.   5  Put your baby gently into the   water. Using one hand for  support, gently swish the water  to wash your baby without  splashing their face. You should  never leave your baby alone  in the water even for a few  seconds. For boys, gently clean  the top of the foreskin of the  penis. The foreskin can be pulled  back very gently to clean.  WASHING AND  BATHING Washing You don’t need to bath your baby  every day, but you should wash  their face, neck, hands and bottom  carefully each day. You can do this  on your lap or on a changing mat.  Choose a time when your baby   is awake and contented, and   make sure the room is warm.   You will need a bowl of warm  water, some cotton wool, a towel  and a fresh nappy. If you want to  use soap, make sure that it is mild  and unperfumed.  1  Take off your baby’s clothes   except for the vest and nappy.  Wrap your baby in a towel.  2  Gently wipe round each eye,  from the nose side outwards.  Use a fresh piece of cotton   wool for each eye, so you   don’t transfer any stickiness   or infection.  3  Using fresh, moist cotton wool,  wipe out each ear – but don’t  clean inside their ears. Never use  cotton buds inside the ear canal. 4  Wash the rest of your baby’s face  and neck with moist cotton wool  and dry gently. Wash and dry your  baby’s hands in the same way. 5  Take off the nappy and wash  your baby’s bottom (genitals),  with fresh cotton wool and  warm water. Dry your baby very  carefully, including in skin folds,  and put on a clean nappy.   144  6  Lift your baby out and pat them  dry with the towel. Dry carefully  in all the creases. If your baby’s  skin is dry, gently massage in  some baby oil or cream (not  aqueous cream). Your baby may  enjoy this.  If your baby seems frightened of  the bath and cries, it may help to  try bathing together. You may like  to do this anyway. Make sure the  water is only warm, not hot, and  don’t add anything to the water.  You should also think about how  you are going to get out of the bath  with your baby. You might need  someone around who you can pass  them to.  ILLNESS It’s sometimes difﬁcult to tell at ﬁrst  when a baby is ill, but you may have  a funny feeling that things are not  quite right. If you are at all worried,  ask for help. You are not fussing.  It’s far better to be on the safe side,  particularly with a very small baby.  Trust your own judgement. You  know your baby best. Very urgent problems Sometimes there are obvious signs  that your baby is not well. Contact  your doctor at once if your baby:  •  turns blue or very pale •  has quick, difﬁcult or grunting   breathing, or unusual periods of  breathing, for example breathing  with pauses of over 20 seconds  between breaths  •(cid:0) is very hard to wake, unusually   drowsy or doesn’t seem to   know you  •  develops a rash of red spots   that do not fade and lose colour  (blanch) when they are pressed  (see the ‘glass test’). This may be  the rash of meningococcal disease  and meningitis, which causes  infection in the blood. There may  not be any other symptoms.   Your baby may need treatment  very quickly. If you cannot get  hold of your GP at once, dial 999  for an ambulance or take your  baby to the nearest accident and  emergency (A&E) department with  a paediatrician on site. Problems that could   be serious •  If your baby has a hoarse cough   with noisy breathing, is wheezing,  or cannot breathe through   the nose.  •  If your baby is unusually hot,   cold or ﬂoppy.  •  If your baby cries in an unusual   way or for an unusually long time  or seems to be in pain.  •  If you notice any bleeding from  the stump of the umbilical cord   or from the nose, or any bruising. •  If your baby keeps refusing feeds. •  If your baby keeps vomiting  a substantial part of feeds or  has frequent watery diarrhoea.  Vomiting and diarrhoea together  may mean your baby is losing too  much ﬂuid, and this may need  prompt treatment.  •  If your baby develops jaundice   (looks yellow) when they are over  a week old, or has jaundice that  continues for over two weeks  after birth (see page 149).  If you have seen your GP and your  baby is not getting better or seems  to be getting worse, tell your GP  again the same day. If you become  very worried and cannot get hold of  your GP, dial 999 for an ambulance  or take your baby to the nearest   A&E department with a  paediatrician on site.   13  T H E        E A R L Y W E E K S  :    Y O U R     B A B Y  If you are worried  about your baby  •  Phone your midwife or health   visitor for advice. Keep their  phone numbers where they  can be reached easily.  •  Phone your GP. Your GP may  be able to advise you over the  phone or may suggest that you  bring your baby along to the  surgery. Most GPs will try to  ﬁt a young baby in without an  appointment, although it may  mean a wait in the surgery.  •  If you are really worried about  your baby, you should always  phone your GP for help  immediately, whatever the  time of day or night. There will  always be a doctor on duty,  even if it is not your own GP.   If you cannot contact a  GP, take your baby to an  appropriate paediatric  emergency department. Not all  A&E departments have resident  paediatricians. You need to  take them to one that does.  The ‘glass test’   The ‘glass test’ can help you  to tell if a rash is a symptom  of meningitis. Press the side or  bottom of a glass ﬁrmly against  the rash. You will be able to see  if the rash fades and loses colour  under the pressure (see photo).   If it doesn’t change colour,   contact your GP immediately.  145  GETTING  SUPPORT Everyone needs advice or  reassurance at some time when  they are caring for a young baby,  even if it’s just to make sure that  they are doing the right thing.   Some problems just need talking  over with someone. It’s always  better to ask for help than to  worry on your own. Do talk to  your midwife or health visitor.  As you grow more conﬁdent,  you will begin to trust your own  judgement more. You will be   able to decide which advice  makes most sense for you and  your baby and which suggestions  you can safely ignore.  You will also want to talk to  friends, relations or other mothers  in a similar situation. You will  meet other mothers when you  start taking your baby to the  child health clinic or Sure Start  Children’s Centre. Your health  visitor will explain where   these are and when you   should go.    Your nearest Children’s Centre   can be found by visiting   www.surestart.gov.uk  Your health visitor can tell you  about any mother and baby  groups in the area. Or your local  branch of the NCT (see page  183) or MAMA (Meet A Mum  Association) (see page 184) may   be able to put you in touch with  other mothers nearby.  Group B  streptococcal  infection Group B streptococcal infection  is a life-threatening infection in  babies. Most babies who are  infected show symptoms within  12 hours of birth, but there   are some who get it later.   The symptoms include:  • being ﬂoppy and unresponsive • not feeding well • grunting • high or low temperature • fast or slow heart rate • fast or slow breathing rate • irritability.

Having a baby   in neonatal care is naturally worrying for parents and every effort should be made   to ensure that you receive the information, communication and support you need.   Not all hospitals provide neonatal services, so it may be necessary to transfer your   baby to another hospital for specialist care.   WHY BABIES NEED ADDITIONAL CARE  Babies can be admitted to   neonatal services for any of the  following reasons:  •  They are born early. One in 10   of all babies are born prematurely.  Babies born earlier than 34   weeks may need extra help   with breathing, feeding and  keeping warm.  •  They are very small and have   a low birth weight.  •  They have an infection. •  Their mother is diabetic. •  The delivery was very difﬁcult   and they need to be kept under  close observation for a time.  •  They have very marked jaundice   (see page 149).  • They are awaiting or recovering   from complex surgery.  close  observation  147  If your baby is unable to have your  breastmilk to begin with, it can be  frozen and given to them when  they are ready. When you go home,  you can express milk for the nurses  to give while you are away. There  is no need to worry about the  quantity or quality of your milk.  Some mothers ﬁnd that providing  breastmilk makes them feel that  they are doing something positive  for their baby.   See Chapter 9 for information on  expressing and storing milk.  INCUBATORS Babies who are very small are  nursed in incubators rather than  cots to keep them warm. However,  you can still have a lot of contact  with your baby. Some incubators  have open tops. If not, you can put  your hands through the holes in the  side of the incubator and touch your  baby. When your baby is stable, the  nurses will be able to help you take  your baby out of the incubator and  show you how to have skin to skin  contact. You should carefully wash  and thoroughly dry your hands  before touching your baby. You can  talk to your baby as well – this can  help both of you.   CONTACT WITH  YOUR BABY  FEEDING To begin with, your baby may be  too small or sick to feed themselves.  You may be asked to express some  of your breastmilk, which can be  given to your baby through a tube.  A ﬁne tube is passed through  their nose or mouth into their  stomach. This will not hurt them.  Breastmilk has particular beneﬁts,  and especially for sick or premature  babies, as it is specially enriched  with fats and minerals.   Your baby will beneﬁt from physical  contact with you, even though the  environment of the unit may seem  strange and confusing. When you  ﬁrst go into the unit, your baby  may be in an incubator and on a  breathing machine. There may also  be tubes and wires attached to their  face and body. Ask the nurse to  explain what everything is for and   to show you how you can be  involved with your baby’s care.   Once your baby is stable, you will   be able to hold them. The nurses  will show you how to do this.  148     BABIES WITH  DISABILITIES If your baby is disabled, you will  be coping with a lot of different  feelings. You will also need to cope  with the feelings of others – your  partner, relations and friends – as  they come to terms with the fact  that your baby has a disability. More  than anything else at this time, you  will need to talk to people about  how you feel as well as about your  baby’s health and future.  Getting information  Hospital staff should explain  what kind of treatment your  baby is being given and why.  If they don’t, make sure you  ask. It is important that you  understand what is happening  so that you can work together  to make sure that your baby  gets the best possible care.  Some treatments will need  your consent and the doctors  will discuss this with you.   It is natural to feel anxious if  your baby requires additional  care. Talk over any fears or  worries with the hospital staff.  Hospitals often have their  own counselling or support  services, and a number of  charities run support and  advice services.  The consultant neonatologist  or paediatrician should  arrange to see you, but  you can also ask for an  appointment at any time if  you wish. The hospital social  worker may be able to help  with practical problems such  as travel costs or help with  looking after other children.  Your own GP, a neonatologist or  paediatrician at your hospital, or  your health visitor can all help you.  You can also contact the hospital  Patient Advice and Liaison Service  (PALS) or your social services  department for information about  local organisations that may   be able to help. In the useful  organisations section (page 182)  you will ﬁnd a list of organisations  that can offer help and advice.  Many are self-help groups run by  parents. Talking to other parents  with similar experiences can often  be the best help.  Help and support  Bliss, the neonatal charity,  supplies all neonatal services  with a free Parent Information  Guide, which you should be  given on admission.  For more information contact  Bliss Family Support Helpline  on freephone 0500 618 140   or visit the website   www.bliss.org.uk  NEWBORN BABIES  WITH JAUNDICE Jaundice in newborn babies is  common because their livers are  immature. Severely jaundiced babies  may be treated with phototherapy.  Babies are undressed and put under  a very bright light, usually with  a soft mask over their eyes. The  special light helps to break down  the chemical that causes jaundice.  It may be possible for your baby to  have phototherapy by your bed so  that you don’t have to be separated.  This treatment may continue for  several days, with breaks for feeds,  before the jaundice clears up. If the  jaundice gets worse, an exchange  transfusion of blood may be  needed. This is not common. Some  babies have jaundice because of  liver disease and need a different  treatment. Your baby will be given  a blood test before phototherapy is  started to check for this. Babies with jaundice  after two weeks Many babies are jaundiced for up  to two weeks following birth. This  can be as long as three weeks in  premature babies. This is common  in breastfed babies and usually it is  normal and does no harm. It is not  a reason to stop breastfeeding. But  it’s important to see your doctor if  your baby is still jaundiced after two  weeks. You should see them within  a day or two. This is particularly  important if your baby’s poo (stools)  is chalky white. A blood test will  show whether your baby has   ‘breastmilk’ jaundice, which will go  away by itself, or jaundice that may  need urgent treatment.  14  B A B  I        E S W H O N E E D A D D T O N A L       I  I  C A R E  149  THE LOSS   OF YOUR BABY  Ectopic pregnancy  Contents Miscarriage  Abnormal test results  Stillbirth and neonatal death   151 151 152 153  Some women may have to cope with miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, termination,  stillbirth or neonatal death (death shortly after birth). This chapter explains why some   of these things may happen.   Antenatal Results and Choices  (ARC) is a voluntary organisation  that supports parents who  are making decisions about  terminating or continuing their  pregnancies. See page 186 for  details.  Help and support  If your pregnancy goes  wrong, you will need both  information and support.  Talk to the people close   to you about how you feel,  and to your midwife, doctor  or health visitor about what  has happened and why.  Sometimes it is easier to  talk to someone who is not  a family member or friend,  for example your doctor,  midwife or health visitor.  There are also a number   of voluntary organisations   that offer support and  information. These are   often run by bereaved  parents. It can be  very helpful to talk to  another parent who has  been through a similar  experience.  The following organisations   may help:  The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust  (www.ectopic.org.uk) offers  support and information for  parents who have had an ectopic  pregnancy. They have a helpline  on 020 7733 2653 and can  put you in touch with other  people who have had an ectopic  pregnancy.   The Miscarriage Association  can give you information and put  you in touch with other parents  who have experienced   a miscarriage. See page   186 for details.  Sands can put you in touch  with other parents who  have had a late miscarriage,  stillbirth or neonatal death.  They also have an internet  forum at www.sandsforum. org and a parents’   telephone helpline on   020 7436 5881.   See page 186 for details.  150  ECTOPIC  PREGNANCY  After fertilisation, the egg should  move down into the uterus to  develop. Sometimes it gets stuck  in the fallopian tube and begins to  grow there. This is called an ectopic  or tubal pregnancy. Rarely, the egg  can become stuck elsewhere,   such as the ovary or the cervix.   The fertilised egg cannot develop  properly and your health may be  at serious risk if the pregnancy  continues. The egg has to be  removed. This can be done through  an operation or with medicines.  Ectopic pregnancy can be caused  by damage in the fallopian tube,  possibly as a result of an infection.  Previous abdominal surgery and  previous ectopic pregnancy can also  increase the risk. The warning signs  start soon after a missed period.   These are:  • severe pain on one side, low   down in the abdomen  • vaginal bleeding or a brown   watery discharge  • pain in your shoulders • feeling dizzy or faint • pain when you have a bowel   movement.  If you have any of these symptoms  and you might be pregnant – even  if you have not had a positive  pregnancy test – you should see  your doctor immediately.   Some women have no obvious  signs or symptoms at all and an  ectopic pregnancy may sometimes  be mistaken for irritable bowel  syndrome, food poisoning or   even appendicitis. Afterwards  You may feel a strong sense of loss  and it is important to give yourself  time to grieve. An ectopic pregnancy  involves abdominal surgery or  treatment with powerful medicines.  It may affect your chances of  becoming pregnant again.   It may be helpful to talk to   your doctor to discuss the possible  causes and whether your   chances of conceiving a baby   have been affected.  MISCARRIAGE If a pregnancy ends before the 24th  week, it is known as a miscarriage.  Miscarriages are quite common in  the ﬁrst three months of pregnancy.  At least one in six conﬁrmed  pregnancies end this way. Many  early miscarriages (before 14 weeks)  happen because there is something  wrong with the development of the  baby. There can be other causes,  such as hormone or blood-clotting  problems. A later miscarriage may  be due to an infection, problems  in the placenta, or the cervix being  weak and opening too early in   the pregnancy.  A miscarriage in the ﬁrst few weeks  may start like a period, with spotting  or bleeding and mild cramps or  backache. The pain and bleeding  may get worse and there can be  heavy bleeding, blood clots and quite  severe cramping pains. With a later  miscarriage, you may go through an  early labour. If you bleed or begin to  have pains at any stage of pregnancy,  you should contact your GP or  midwife. You could also contact your  local early pregnancy unit (though  they may want a referral from your   GP before they see you). If you  are more than six or seven weeks  pregnant, you may be referred for an  ultrasound scan to see if your baby  has a heartbeat and is developing  normally. Sometimes the bleeding  stops by itself and your pregnancy  will carry on quite normally.   Some women ﬁnd out that their  baby has died only when they have  a routine scan. If they have had no  pain or bleeding, this can come as  a terrible shock, especially if the  scan shows that the baby died days  or weeks before. This is sometimes  called a missed or silent miscarriage. Treatment for  miscarriage Sometimes it is preferable to wait  and let the miscarriage happen  naturally, but there are three ways  of actively managing a miscarriage:   •(cid:0)Medicine. You may be offered  tablets or pessaries to start the  process of miscarriage.   •(cid:0)Operation. If you have been   pregnant for less than 14  weeks, your doctor may advise  an operation called an ERPC  (evacuation of retained   products of conception).   This will empty your uterus.   It is done under anaesthetic.   15  T H E       L O S S O F   Y O U R     B A B Y  151  You may feel shocked, distressed,  angry, or just numb. You may  feel guilty, wondering whether  your miscarriage was caused  by anything you did or did not  do. It is important to know that,  whatever the cause, miscarriage  is never anyone’s fault. If a  miscarriage is going to happen,  there is very little that anyone   can do to stop it.  Some people ﬁnd having  something to remember their  baby by helps. In an early  loss, this may be a copy of a  scan picture. If you have a late  miscarriage, you may be able   to see and hold your baby if you  wish. You might also be able   to take photographs, footprints  and handprints as a keepsake.  Some hospitals offer parents   a certiﬁcate to commemorate   their baby. This is done because  there is no formal registration   of a baby who dies before   24 weeks of pregnancy.   Talk about your feelings with your  partner and those close to you.  You might also want to contact  the Miscarriage Association or  Sands (see page 150).  ABNORMAL   TEST RESULTS When tests show that the baby  has a signiﬁcant abnormality,  some couples wish to continue the  pregnancy and be prepared for  the needs of their newborn baby.  Others decide to terminate the  pregnancy. If tests show that your  baby has a serious abnormality,  ﬁnd out as much as you can from  your doctor about the particular  condition and how it might affect  your baby, so that you can make   a decision that is right for you   and your family.   You will probably be very shocked  when you are ﬁrst told the diagnosis  and may ﬁnd it hard to take in.   You may need to go back and talk  to the doctor with your partner or  someone close to you. Spend time  talking things through. You may also  ﬁnd it helpful to contact Antenatal  Results and Choices (see page 150). What happens A termination in the ﬁrst three  months can be done under a general  anaesthetic. A later termination  usually involves going through labour.   You may wish to think beforehand  about whether you want to see and  perhaps even hold your baby, and  whether you want to give your baby  a name. If you do not want to see  your baby, you could ask hospital  staff to take a photograph for you  in case you want to see it in the  future. The photograph can be   kept in your notes. Afterwards You may ﬁnd it hard to cope after a  termination. It can help to talk, but  sometimes family and friends ﬁnd it  difﬁcult to understand what you are  going through. If you would like to  make contact with people who have  undergone a similar experience, you  can contact Antenatal Results and  Choices (see page 150).    The cervix is gently widened and   the contents of your uterus are  removed by suction.   •(cid:0)Induced labour. If your baby  dies after about 14 weeks, you  may go into labour. If this doesn’t  happen, you will be offered  tablets that start labour.   Although some women would  prefer not to go through  labour, this is safer for you than  an operation to remove the  baby. You will be cared for and  supported throughout the labour  and the birth of your baby.   Afterwards  One early miscarriage is unlikely   to affect your chances of having   a baby in the future. If you have   three or more early miscarriages in  a row, you should be referred to a  specialist for further investigations.  However, sometimes no clear   cause can be found.  Both women and men ﬁnd it  difﬁcult to come to terms with a  miscarriage at any stage. You will  almost certainly feel a sense of loss.  You will need time to grieve over  the lost baby just as you would over  the death of anyone close to you,  especially if the miscarriage has  happened later in your pregnancy.   152  STILLBIRTH AND  NEONATAL DEATH In the UK about 4,000 babies are  stillborn every year. This means that  the pregnancy has lasted for 24  weeks or more and the baby is   dead when it is born. About the  same number of babies die soon  after birth. Often the causes of  these deaths are not known.  Sometimes a baby dies in the uterus  (an intra-uterine death or IUD) but  labour does not start spontaneously.  If this happens, you will be given  medicines to induce the labour. This  is the safest way of delivering the  baby. It also means that you and  your partner can see and hold the  baby at birth if you want to.  It is shocking to lose a baby like this.  You and your partner are likely to  experience a range of emotions that  come and go unpredictably. These  can include disbelief, anger, guilt  and grief. Some women think they  can hear their baby crying, and it is  not uncommon for mothers to think  that they can still feel their baby  kicking inside. The grief is usually  most intense in the early months   after the loss.  after the loss.   Some parents ﬁnd  Some parents ﬁnd  it helpful to create  it helpful to create  memories of their baby,  memories of their baby,  for example they may  for example they may  see and hold their baby  see and hold their baby  and give their baby a name. You may  and give their baby a name. You may  want to have a photograph of your  baby and to keep some mementos,  such as a lock of hair, hand and  footprints or the baby’s shawl. All  this can help you and your family to  remember your baby as a real person  and may, in time, help you to live  with your loss. You may also ﬁnd it  helpful to talk to your GP, community  midwife or health visitor or to other  parents who have lost a baby. Sands  can put you in touch with other  parents who can offer support and  information (see page 150).   Post-mortems One of the ﬁrst questions you  are likely to ask is why your baby  died. Sometimes a post-mortem  examination can help to provide  some answers, although often no  clear cause is found. A post-  mortem may, however, provide   other information that could be  helpful for future pregnancies and  may rule out certain causes. If it  is thought that a post-mortem  could be helpful, a senior doctor or  midwife will discuss this with you  and explain the possible beneﬁts.   If you decide to have a full or partial  post-mortem, you will be asked  to sign a consent form. When the  post-mortem report is available,   you will be offered an appointment   with a consultant who can   explain the results to you and   also what these might mean   for a future pregnancy. Multiple births The loss of one baby from a   multiple pregnancy is very difﬁcult  for any parent. Grieving for the  baby who has died while caring   for and celebrating the life of   the surviving baby brings very   mixed and complex emotions.   Often the surviving baby is  premature and in a neonatal   unit, causing additional concern.   For further information and   support, contact the Multiple   Births Foundation or Tamba   (see pages 183 and 188 for   contact details).   15  T H E       L O S S O F   Y O U R     B A B Y     Saying goodbye to your baby  A funeral or some other way   of saying goodbye can be a very  important part of coping   with your loss, however early   it happens.   If your baby dies before 24 weeks,  the hospital may offer to arrange  for a cremation, possibly together  with other babies who have died  in pregnancy. If you prefer to take  your baby home or to make your  own arrangements, you can do  that. You may need some form  of certiﬁcation from the hospital  and they should provide helpful  information and contacts.   The Miscarriage Association   and Sands can provide further  support and information.  If your baby dies after 24 weeks,  you will need to register your  baby’s birth (even if they were  stillborn) with the Registrar of  Births, Deaths and Marriages.   The hospital will offer to arrange  a funeral, burial or cremation free  of charge, or you may choose to  organise this yourself. The hospital  chaplain will be able to help you.   Alternatively, you may prefer  to contact someone from your  own religious community, the  Miscarriage Association or Sands  about the kind of funeral you  want. You do not have to attend  the funeral if you don’t want to.  Many hospitals arrange a regular  service of remembrance for all  babies who die in pregnancy, at  birth or in infancy. Again, you   can choose to attend if you wish.  Many parents are surprised at  how much and how long they  grieve after losing a baby. Friends  and acquaintances often don’t  know what to say or how to offer  support, and they may expect  you to get back to ‘normal’ long  before that is possible. You may  ﬁnd it helpful to contact Sands   or the Miscarriage Association   (see page 150) so that you can   talk to people who have been  through similar experiences   and who can offer you   support and information.  153  THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT BABY?  It takes two  Folic acid  Things to consider  Work-related risks   154 154 155  155  Holding your new baby in your arms, it may be impossible to imagine that you will  ever have the energy to go through it all again! But sooner or later, you may decide  that you want another child.  If you had a low birth weight baby, a baby with a disability or special needs,   a miscarriage or a stillbirth, you may be particularly anxious to do everything you can  to create the best possible circumstances for your next pregnancy. This chapter explains  how you and your partner can prepare for your next pregnancy.     Finding it hard   to get pregnant?  It can take several months   or more to get pregnant,  even if it happened really  quickly the ﬁrst time. quickly the ﬁrst time.  Chapter 1 (page 14) explains  when is the best time of the  month to have sex if you  want to get pregnant.   If you are still not pregnant  after a few months, talk  to your doctor or family  planning clinic.  IT TAKES TWO You will increase your chances of  getting pregnant if you are in good  health – and that applies to men  too. A bad diet, smoking, drinking  and unhealthy working conditions  can affect the quality of sperm  and stop you getting pregnant.  You should both try to make your  lifestyle as healthy as possible   before you try to conceive.  Chapter 3 has advice about diet,  smoking, alcohol and exercise,  which can help you to conceive.   FOLIC ACID Women should take 400  micrograms of folic acid from the  time you start trying to conceive  right up until you are 12 weeks  pregnant. You can get these tablets  from a supermarket or pharmacist.  Eat foods that contain this  important vitamin as well.   154  These include green, leafy  vegetables, and breakfast cereals  and breads with added folic acid.   You will need a bigger dose of folic  acid if:  • you already have a baby with   spina biﬁda  • you have coeliac disease • you have diabetes  • you take anti-epileptic medicines.   Ask your GP for advice as well.  THINGS TO  CONSIDER Rubella (German  measles) Rubella in early pregnancy can  damage your developing baby.   If you were not immune during your  last pregnancy, you should have  been offered a measles, mumps  and rubella (MMR) immunisation  immediately after your baby was  born. Before trying for another  baby, it is important to check that  you are immune by having a blood  test. The blood test will measure  if you have enough protection  (antibodies) against rubella. Women  with low or uncertain levels of  antibodies can be immunised again. Your weight Maintaining a healthy weight can  improve your chances of getting  pregnant. You may have put on  weight during your last pregnancy  and want to go back to your normal  size. This is particularly important  if you weigh more than 100kg.  The best way to lose weight is by  following a balanced low-fat diet  and doing exercise. It might help to  join a slimming class with a friend  or your partner to encourage and  support you. Speak to your doctor   if you need help or advice.  Medicines and drugs Some medicines can harm a baby   in pregnancy but others are safe.   If either you or your partner has a  long-term illness or disability and has  to take long-term medication, talk  to your doctor about any possible  effects on fertility or pregnancy.   Check with your doctor, midwife   or pharmacist before you take   any over the counter drugs.   Illegal drugs will affect your ability  to conceive and can damage  your baby’s health. See page 183  for contact details for Narcotics  Anonymous or talk to FRANK,   the drugs information line,   on 0800 77 66 00. Diabetes and epilepsy If you have diabetes or epilepsy,   talk to your doctor before you try   to get pregnant. Postnatal depression  and puerperal  psychosis If you have previously experienced  postnatal depression or puerperal  psychosis, talk to your doctor before  you try to get pregnant. Sexually transmitted  infections (STIs) STIs can affect your health and your  ability to conceive. If there is any  chance that either of you has an STI,  it’s important to get it diagnosed   and treated before you get pregnant.  STIs, including HIV, hepatitis B  and hepatitis C, can be passed on  through sex with an infected person,  especially if you don’t use a condom.  Some STIs can be transmitted  during sex without penetration. HIV,  hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also  be passed on by sharing equipment  for injecting drugs.  If you are HIV positive, you can  pass the virus on to your baby  during pregnancy, at birth or when  breastfeeding (see box on page 47).  16  WORK-RELATED  RISKS Your employer is required to take  into account any work-related risks  to new and expectant mothers.   Once you have told your employer  that you are pregnant, they should  make sure that your job does not  pose a risk to you or your baby.  Some risks can be avoided, for  example by changing your working  conditions or hours of work.   If a risk cannot be avoided, your  employer should offer you suitable  alternative work with similar terms  and conditions to your present job.  If this is not possible, you should   be suspended on full pay. This  means that you will be given paid  leave for as long as necessary.

Vaginal birth after   a caesarean section  Most women who have  had a caesarean section  can have a vaginal delivery  for their next baby. This  depends on why you had  a caesarean section the  ﬁrst time. Women thought  to have a small pelvis, for  example, may be advised to  have a ‘planned’ (elective)  caesarean section next time.  Your GP, or midwife, will  be able to advise you. Most  women who are advised to  try for a vaginal delivery in  subsequent pregnancies do  have normal deliveries.

You can make a claim for MA from  the 14th week before the week  your baby is due.   • Fill in form MA1, available from  Jobcentre Plus or your antenatal  clinic.   •(cid:0)Download an MA claim pack in   PDF format from   www.dwp.gov.uk/advisers/ claimforms/ma1.pdf   • Contact Jobcentre Plus on   0800 055 6688.  You must also send your maternity  certiﬁcate (form MAT B1). This is  issued by your GP or midwife from  20 weeks before the week your  baby is due.  MATERNITY  BENEFITS Maternity Allowance What is it?  Maternity Allowance (MA) is a  weekly allowance paid through  Jobcentre Plus.   Who gets it? Women who cannot get Statutory  Maternity Pay (see page 165) get  MA. These are:  • women who have changed jobs   during pregnancy  • women who have had periods of   low earnings or unemployment  during pregnancy   • women who are self-employed.  You can claim MA if you have been  employed and/or self-employed in  at least 26 of the 66 weeks before  your expected week of childbirth.  This 66-week period is known as  the test period. You must also have  gross average weekly earnings of at  least £30. The average is taken over  any 13 weeks in the test period.  You should choose the 13 weeks  in which you earned the most.  In your chosen weeks, you can  add together earnings from more  than one job, including any self- employed work. You will be treated  as earning a certain amount if you  are self-employed.  17  I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  163  Jobcentre Plus will check this. If you  are not sure whether or not you  qualify, phone Jobcentre Plus for  more information.   How much is it? • £64.30 per week if you are aged   25 or over.   • £50.95 if you are aged under 25.   You may get more than this in some  circumstances, for example if you  have a partner who is not working  and is not claiming beneﬁts for  themselves.  It is awarded from the Sunday of  the sixth week before your baby  is due until two weeks after your  baby’s birth. It may not be paid for  the ﬁrst three days of your claim.   How do I claim? Make a claim for Maternity  Allowance using form MA1, which  you can get from Jobcentre Plus or  your antenatal clinic. You also have  to send your maternity certiﬁcate  (form MAT B1), which is issued by  your GP or midwife from 20 weeks  before the week your baby is due.  You don’t need to send in a sick  note from your doctor.   If you are not entitled to Maternity  Allowance, Jobcentre Plus will  check automatically to see if you  qualify for Employment and Support  Allowance. It can be paid directly  into your bank. You must claim  within three months of the start   of your entitlement.  More information  To ﬁnd out more about Employment  and Support Allowance:   • call Jobcentre Plus on   0800 055 6688  • ask for leaﬂet DWP 1001, or • visit the website at   www.dwp.gov.uk/esa   If you are employed in the 15th  week before your baby is due  and do not qualify for Statutory  Maternity Pay, you must also send   in form SMP1 from your employer  to show why you don’t qualify.   You will have to provide original  payslips to show you meet the  earnings condition.   If you are self-employed, Jobcentre  Plus will conﬁrm this direct with Her  Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.  When you have completed your  claim form, send it to Jobcentre  Plus, together with your maternity  certiﬁcate (MAT B1) and your  original payslips.  Claim as soon as you can, even if  you are still at work, do not have the  medical certiﬁcate, or cannot provide  any other information needed to  complete the claim form. You can  always send things in later. You must  claim within three months of the  date your MA period is due to start.  If you delay, you will lose money.  How is it paid? MA is paid directly into your bank  account, weekly or every four   weeks in arrears.   Working during the  Maternity Allowance pay  period You are allowed to work as an  employed or self-employed person  for up to 10 days during your MA  pay period without losing any MA.   These 10 days are called Keeping  in Touch (KIT) days. Once you have  used up your 10 KIT days, if you  do any further work you will lose a  day’s MA for any day on which you  work. You must tell Jobcentre Plus  about any work you do.  The amount you get paid for the  days you work in your MA pay  period will not affect your MA.  More information If you are not entitled to MA,  your Jobcentre Plus ofﬁce will  automatically check whether you  might be entitled to Employment  and Support Allowance (see below).  For further information about  MA, see leaﬂet NI17A, A Guide to  Maternity Beneﬁts, available from  www.dwp.gov.uk/advisers/ni17a  Employment and  Support Allowance  What is it? This is a weekly allowance that is  normally paid to people whose  ability to work is limited because of  an illness or disability. It may also be  paid to women who don’t qualify  for Statutory Maternity Pay or  Maternity Allowance.   Who gets it? Women who have paid enough  National Insurance contributions  during the last three tax years or  women who are on a low income.  164  Find the Sunday before your baby  is due (or the due date if it is a  Sunday) and count back 11   Sundays from there.   It is up to you to decide when you  want to stop work, unless your job  ﬁnishes before your SMP starts or  you are off work for pregnancy- related reasons in the four weeks  before your baby is due.   If your job ﬁnishes before the 11th  week before the week your baby is  due, your SMP must start 11 weeks  before the week your baby is due.   If your job ﬁnishes after the 11th  week but before your SMP is due to  start, your SMP must start the day  after you left your job. If you are still  employed you can choose to work  right up until the date the baby is  due, unless:  • you are absent from work because   of pregnancy-related reasons  during the four weeks before the  week that your baby is due. In  that case your SMP should start  automatically the day following  the ﬁrst day of absence from  work, or   • your baby is born before the start   of your SMP. In that case your  SMP will start the day following  the birth and will be paid for   39 weeks.   Statutory   Maternity Pay What is it?  Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)  is money paid by your employer  to help you take time off at and  around the birth of your baby. It is  paid up to a maximum of 39 weeks.  Your employer can claim back  some or all of it from Her Majesty’s  Revenue and Customs (HMRC).  SMP counts as earnings and your  employer will deduct tax and  National Insurance.   You can get it even if you don’t plan  to go back to work or you leave your  employment after you qualify for  SMP. You will not have to pay SMP  back if you don’t return to work.   You may qualify for SMP from   more than one employer.   Who gets it? You get SMP if:  • you have been continuously   employed for at least 26 weeks  by the same employer up to  the qualifying week. This is the  15th week before the week your  baby is due. This means you  must have been employed  by that employer before you  were pregnant. Part weeks  count as full weeks and one day’s  employment in the qualifying  week counts as a full week, and  • you earn an average of £95 a   week before tax. This amount is  called the Lower Earnings Limit for  National Insurance contributions  and is the amount you have to  earn to qualify for beneﬁts. You  have to earn more than this  amount before you actually start  paying National Insurance.  Your earnings are averaged over an  eight-week period, running up to  and including the 15th week before  the week your baby is due. This  period may vary slightly depending   on whether you are paid weekly,  monthly, or at other intervals.  To ﬁnd out which is your qualifying  week, look on a calendar for the  Sunday before your baby is due   (or the due date if that is a Sunday).  Count back 15 Sundays from there.  You should use the due date on  the MAT B1 certiﬁcate, which your  midwife or GP will give you when  you are 20 weeks pregnant.   If you are not sure if you are entitled  to SMP, ask your employer anyway.  Your employer will work out whether  or not you should get it, and if   you don’t qualify they will give   you form SMP1 to explain why.   If your employer is not sure how   to work out your SMP or how to   claim it back, they can ring the  HMRC Employer Helpline on   08457 143 143 for advice.   How much is it? SMP is paid for a maximum of   39 weeks.   • For the ﬁrst six weeks you get   90% of your average gross weekly  earnings, with no upper limit.   • For the remaining 33 weeks, you  get a standard rate of £123.06,  or 90% of your average gross  weekly earnings if 90% is less  than £123.06.  SMP is usually paid in the same  way and at the same time as your  normal wages, but your employer  may decide to pay differently, for  example in a lump sum.  When is it paid? The earliest you can start your SMP  is 11 weeks before the week your  baby is due. The latest is the day  following the birth.   To work out the earliest date,  use the due date on your MAT  B1 certiﬁcate, which your  midwife or GP will   give you.   17  I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  165  You can work for up to 10 days for  the employer who pays you SMP  and still keep the SMP for the weeks  in which you do that work. These  days are called Keeping in Touch  (KIT) days.   After that, if you do any further  work you cannot get SMP for any  week in which you work for the  employer who pays you.   If you return to work early, your  SMP will stop. Your SMP cannot  start again once you have stopped  your maternity leave.  If after the birth you start work   for a new employer who did not  employ you in the 15th week before  the week your baby was due, you  must tell the employer paying your  SMP. They will then stop paying  your SMP.  How do I claim? You must give your employer at  least 28 days’ notice of the date you  want to start your pay. They may  need this in writing. You must also  send your maternity certiﬁcate (MAT  B1 form), which is issued by your GP  or midwife from 20 weeks before  the week your baby is due.  You can give notice for leave and  pay together in the 15th week  before the week your baby is due.  You can change your mind about  the dates you have given for the  start of your SMP but you must give  your employer 28 days’ notice of  this change and conﬁrm the new  date in writing.  More information See leaﬂet NI17A, A Guide to  Maternity Beneﬁts, which is  available from www.dwp.gov.uk/ advisers/ni17a  IF YOU ARE  UNEMPLOYED Contribution-based  Jobseeker’s Allowance What is it?  Contribution-based Jobseeker’s  Allowance (JSA) is an allowance that  lasts for up to 26 weeks for people  who are unemployed or working  less than 16 hours a week.   Who gets it? You get it if:  • you have paid enough National  Insurance contributions during  the last two tax years before the  current calendar year. Tax years  run from April to March.  • you are available for work for  as many hours as your caring  responsibilities permit (this must  be at least 16 hours a week), and   • you are actively seeking work.   How much is it? • £50.95 a week if you are under 25. • £64.30 a week if you are 25   or over.   Your partner’s earnings are not  taken into account, but, if you are   in part-time work, your earnings  are and will reduce how much  beneﬁt you get.   The beneﬁt is paid directly into   your bank account, normally every  two weeks.  How do I claim? Go to your local Jobcentre Plus,  or claim by post if you live too far  away. You will have to go to your  Jobcentre Plus every fortnight to  ‘sign on’ to show that you are  available for work.   More information If your family has no other income,  you will probably be entitled to  income-based JSA and other  beneﬁts for families on low   incomes (see page 159).  If you resign from   your job If you resign from your job and  don’t go back to work after  maternity leave, you may be able to  claim contribution-based Jobseeker’s  Allowance (JSA) for up to six  months. However, you will have to  show that you had ‘just cause’ for  voluntarily leaving your job. You will  also have to be available for work  for as many hours a week as your  caring responsibilities permit. This  must be at least 16 hours a week.  If you have not paid enough National  Insurance contributions, you may  be able to claim income-based JSA  instead (see page 159), depending  on your personal circumstances.  Apply in person at your local  Jobcentre Plus.   If you are a single parent, you may  be able to claim Income Support  (see page 159) once your baby   is born.   Remember that you may still be  able to claim tax credits if you are  unemployed (Child Tax Credit for  your children; Working Tax Credit if  your partner works enough hours).  Apply to Jobcentre Plus for Income  Support or to Her Majesty’s Revenue  and Customs for tax credits.  166  MATERNITY LEAVE MATERNITY LEAVE All employed women are entitled to 52 weeks’ maternity leave, no matter  All employed women are entitled to 52 weeks’ maternity leave, no matter  how long they have worked for their employer, or the hours they worked.  how long they have worked for their employer, or the hours they worked.

Additional Maternity  Leave All employed women:  • can take 26 weeks’ leave from the   end of their Ordinary Maternity  Leave, and  • have the right to return to the   same job. If that is not reasonably  practicable, then you have the  right to a suitable job on very  similar terms and conditions.  When does maternity   leave start? The earliest you can start your  statutory maternity leave is   11 weeks before the expected  week of childbirth. This is when    you are about 29 weeks pregnant,  so count back from the due date on  your MAT B1 certiﬁcate, which your  midwife or GP will give you. Find  the Sunday before your baby is due  (or the due date if it is a Sunday)  and count back 11 Sundays   from there.   You can decide when you want  to stop work. You can even work  right up until the date your baby is  born, unless:  • you have a pregnancy-related   illness/absence in the last four  weeks of your pregnancy.  In this case your employer can  start your maternity leave even  if you are off sick for only one  day. However, if you are ill for  only a short time, your employer  may agree to let you start your  maternity leave when you had  planned, or  • your baby is born before the day  you were planning to start your  leave. In this case leave will start   on the day after you give birth.  You should tell your employer   as soon as you can that you   have given birth.   How to give notice Telling your employer   that you are pregnant The latest time you can tell your  employer that you are pregnant   is the 15th week before your baby  is due. However, it is best to tell  your employer as soon as possible  to make sure that you have health  and safety protection during your  pregnancy and the right to paid  time off for antenatal care. The law  protects you from being dismissed  or discriminated against because  you are pregnant.  If you cannot give notice by the  15th week before you are due   (for example, because you have   to go into hospital unexpectedly),  you must give notice as soon as   you reasonably can.   I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  167  Giving notice for statutory  maternity leave To give notice that you will be  taking maternity leave, you must tell  your employer the following in or  before the 15th week before your  baby is due. It is probably best to  put this in writing:  Working out the 15th week  before your baby is due Find the Sunday before your baby  is due (or the due date if it is a  Sunday) and count back 15 Sundays  from there. That is the start of the  15th week before the expected  week when your baby is due.   to either Statutory Maternity Pay  or Maternity Allowance (see pages  165 and 163). After that your leave  will be unpaid. Some employers  also offer extra maternity pay: check  your contract, or ask the human  resources department or your union  representative.  • that you are pregnant • the expected week of childbirth,   and  • the date on which you intend   to start your maternity leave.  If you want to change the date  on which you start your maternity  leave, you must give your employer  notice of the new date at least 28  days before either the new date or  the old date – whichever is earliest.  If there is a good reason why that is  not possible, tell your employer as  soon as you reasonably can.  You can choose when to start  maternity leave, but the earliest you  can start getting Statutory Maternity  Pay is in the 11th week before the  week your baby is due.  Once you have given notice, your  employer must write to you within  28 days and state the date you   are expected to return from  maternity leave.  You should use the due date on  the MAT B1 certiﬁcate that your  midwife or GP will give you when  you are about 20 weeks pregnant.  RIGHTS DURING  MATERNITY LEAVE Since 5 October 2008, your  contractual rights (that is, any  special rights that apply to your  particular workplace, such as a  company car) continue throughout  your maternity leave (Ordinary  Maternity Leave (OML) and  Additional Maternity Leave (AML))  as if you were still at work. This  includes your legal right to 5.6  weeks’ paid annual leave (normally  28 days for full-time employees and  the pro-rata equivalent for part- time workers) whether you are on  maternity leave or not. This does  not include your normal pay.  During the ﬁrst 39 weeks of your  leave you will probably be entitled   If you are made redundant while   on maternity leave, your employer  must offer you any suitable  alternative work that is available.   If there is none, they must give   you any notice and redundancy   pay that you are entitled to,  although they could offset any  maternity pay you get from the  notice pay. Also, your employer  must not discriminate against  you by failing to consider you for  opportunities such as promotion.   For more information visit   www.direct.gov.uk/workandfamilies   Pay During OML and the ﬁrst 13 weeks  of AML, you may be entitled to  Maternity Allowance or Statutory  Maternity Pay (see pages 163 and  165). After that your leave will  usually be unpaid. Some employers  offer extra (or contractual) maternity  pay, so check your contract or ask  the human resources department   or your union representative.   Rights and beneﬁts in pregnancy This guide shows you when you should claim for a range of beneﬁts. The timing of your  rights and beneﬁts in pregnancy is very complicated, so use this chart as a rough guide only.  In this box, write in the date of the Sunday before the  ﬁrst day of your last period. (If your last period started  on a Sunday, write in that date.) Then work along the  top row ﬁlling in the dates of each successive Sunday.  You can claim the Health in Pregnancy   Grant payment from this week.  Write in the ﬁrst day of your last period here. Then work along the row ﬁlling in the remaining boxes.   Each box represents a week. Write in the dates week by week until you get to the date on which your baby is due.  168  Discrimination Your employer must not  discriminate against you while you  are on maternity leave. This means  that they have to consider you for  opportunities such as promotion.   If you are made redundant while on  maternity leave, your employer must  offer you any suitable alternative  work that is available. If there is  none, they must pay you any notice  and redundancy pay that you are  entitled to.   RETURNING   TO WORK Giving notice about  returning to work Your employer should assume  that you will be taking your full  entitlement of 52 weeks unless you  tell them otherwise. You will be due  back to work on the day after the  52-week period of maternity leave.   If you want to take all of your  leave, you simply go back to work  on that day.  If you decide not to take some or  all of your maternity leave, whether  Ordinary Maternity Leave (OML) or  Additional Maternity Leave (AML),  you should give eight weeks’ notice  to return to work early. Even if you  only wish to take OML, or you just  want to be off work while you still   get maternity pay, you must give  eight weeks’ notice of your return  as you will in fact be returning early.   If you don’t give this notice and just  turn up at work before the end of  your maternity leave, your employer  can refuse to allow you to work for  up to eight weeks or until the end  of your leave, whichever is earlier.  If you change your mind and wish  to continue taking your maternity  leave, you must give your employer  eight weeks’ notice before the  earlier date of return.  The law does not allow you to  work for two weeks (four weeks  if you work in a factory) after  childbirth. This period is known as  Compulsory Maternity Leave.  You will not be allowed to return to  work during this time.   Your job when you go back When you go back to work after  AML, you have the right to return to  the same job. But if your employer  can show that this is not reasonably  practicable, you have the right to  be offered a suitable alternative  job on at least the same terms and  conditions. If the job no longer  exists, this could be a redundancy  situation and you should get advice.  You should also be offered any  suitable alternative vacancies if   your post is made redundant   while you are on maternity leave.  You must have notiﬁed your employer of your  pregnancy, the expected week of childbirth and  the date you want to start Ordinary Maternity  Leave. This is also your ‘qualifying’ week for  Statutory Maternity Pay.  This is the earliest you can start  your maternity leave and Maternity  Allowance or Statutory Maternity Pay.  If you need more time  off work  17  I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  If you stay off work after your  maternity leave has ended, you will  lose your right to return to the same  job. If you need more time off you  could do one of the following:  • Ask your employer if you can take   annual leave immediately after  your maternity leave. Your paid  holiday continues to accrue during  maternity leave so you may have  some holiday owing to you.  • Take some parental leave at the  end of your maternity leave (see  page 172). You must give 21 days’  notice to take parental leave, and  it is usually unpaid, unless your  employer offers paid parental leave.   • If you cannot return because you  are ill, you can take sick leave as  long as you follow your   employer’s sickness procedures.   If you are not able to take annual  leave and don’t have enough  notice to ask for parental leave, you  can still ask your employer if they  will agree to a further period off  work (this will usually be unpaid).  You should ask your employer to  conﬁrm this agreement in writing  and to conﬁrm that you will have  the right to return to the same job.  You should also check whether your  employer is counting this as part of  your parental leave entitlement.   You should apply for Maternity   Allowance about now.  If you qualify for a Sure Start Maternity Grant  from the Social Fund, claim it as soon as possible.  The date your   baby is due.  169  work after your leave. You will need  to agree with your employer what  work is to be done on KIT days and  how much pay you will receive. If you are   pregnant again Maternity leave does not break  your continuity of employment,  so if you are pregnant again, your  right to maternity leave will be  based on your total service with  your employer. You may also  qualify for Statutory Maternity  Pay (SMP), as long as you meet  the normal conditions. However,  this will mean you will have to be  receiving an average of at least  £95 per week from your   employer, worked out over  approximately weeks 18–25  of your pregnancy when SMP  entitlement is calculated.  If you have already taken Ordinary  Maternity Leave (OML) and  Additional Maternity Leave (AML) (a year off) you will be entitled to a  second period of OML and AML. If  you go straight into another period  of OML without physically returning  to work and decide to return to  work after the second period of  OML, you will not have the right  to return to exactly the same job  as you normally would at the end  of OML. However, you will have  the same right as you would have  had at the end of AML. This is the  right to return to the same job or,  if that is not reasonably practicable,  a suitable alternative job on similar  terms and conditions.   If you return to work after the end  of your ﬁrst period of AML and  before the start of your second  period of OML, your rights to  maternity leave are not affected.  maternity leave are not affected.  maternity leave are not affected.  This means that you have the  right to return to exactly the  same job after your second  period of OML. This applies  even if you only returned to   work for one day.  If you don’t go back   to work You should resign in the normal  way, giving at least the notice  required by your contract or the  notice period that is normally given  in your workplace. If you don’t   have a contract, you should give   at least a week’s notice.  If you say you are going to return to  work and then change your mind,  you can resign from your job in the  normal way. Your notice period  can run at the same time as your  maternity leave.   If you don’t go back to work,  you don’t have to repay any   of the Statutory Maternity  Pay you received during your  maternity leave.   Work during   maternity leave During maternity leave it is often  helpful to keep in touch with your  employer. Your employer is entitled  to make reasonable contact with  you during maternity leave. This  might be to discuss things like  arrangements for your return to  work, or to update you on any  signiﬁcant changes in the workplace  while you have been away.  You are entitled to do up to 10  days’ work during your maternity  leave without losing maternity pay  or bringing your leave to an end.  These Keeping in Touch (KIT) days  may only be worked if both you  and your employer agree. Although  particularly useful for things such as  training or team events, they may  be used for any form of work and  should make it easier to return to   170  OTHER  EMPLOYMENT  RIGHTS These rights apply no matter   how long you have been  employed or how many hours   you work per week. Paid time off for  antenatal care If you are an employee, you  have the right to take reasonable  time off for your antenatal  appointments, including time  needed to travel to your clinic or  GP, without loss of pay.  You should let your employer  know when you need time off.   For appointments after the ﬁrst  one, your employer can ask to   see your appointment card and   a certiﬁcate stating that you   are pregnant.   Antenatal care can include  antenatal education and relaxation  classes. You may need a letter from  your GP or midwife to show your  employer, saying that these classes  are part of your antenatal care. Health and safety  rights  If you are pregnant, have recently  given birth or are breastfeeding,  your employer must make sure  that the kind of work you do and  your working conditions will not  put your health or your baby’s  health at risk. To get the full  beneﬁt of this legal protection,  you must notify your employer  in writing that you are pregnant,  have recently given birth or   are breastfeeding.  • Your employer must carry   out a risk assessment at your  workplace and do everything  reasonable to remove or reduce  the risks found.   • If there are still risks, your   employer must change your  working conditions or hours of  work to remove the risk.   • If this is not possible or would   not remove the risk, your  employer must offer you a  suitable alternative job.   • If this is not possible, your   employer must suspend you on  full pay for as long as is necessary  to avoid the risk. If you do night  work and your doctor advises  that you should stop for health  and safety reasons, you have  the right to transfer to day work  or, if that is not possible, to be  suspended on full pay. You must  provide a medical certiﬁcate.   Dismissal or   unfair treatment It is sex discrimination for your  employer to treat you unfairly,  dismiss you or select you for  redundancy for any reason  connected with pregnancy,  childbirth or maternity leave.   If you are dismissed while you are  pregnant or during your maternity  leave, your employer must give  you a written statement of the  reasons. You may also have a  claim for compensation for sex  discrimination. If you are making  a claim against your employer,  you must put your claim into the  Employment Tribunal within three  months of the problem arising –  get advice as soon as possible.   OTHER TYPES   OF LEAVE Paternity leave Paternity leave is one or two weeks’  leave to care for a child or support  their mother.   Who gets it? Your baby’s biological father, your  husband or your partner, including  a same-sex partner, will be able to  take paternity leave providing they:   • expect to have responsibility for   bringing up the child, and  • have worked for the same employer   for at least 26 weeks by the 15th  week before your baby is due.   If your partner is not the biological  father and is not married to you or  in a civil partnership with you, they  must live with you and your baby   to get paternity leave.  When does it start? It can start:   • from the date of your baby’s birth • from a chosen number of days  or weeks after the date of your  baby’s birth (whether this is earlier  or later than expected), or   • from a chosen date.  Paternity leave must be taken within  56 days of your baby’s birth or, if  your baby is born early, within the  period from the actual date of birth  up to 56 days after the expected  week of birth.   Your partner will be able to return   to the same job after paternity leave.   Statutory Paternity   Pay  Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) is paid  by employers for up to two weeks.  Who gets it? Your partner can get SPP if they:  • are the baby’s father or your   husband/partner and are  responsible for the baby’s  upbringing (your partner must   live with you and your baby if they  are not the biological father and  are not married to you or in a civil  partnership with you)  • have worked for an employer   for 26 weeks by the 15th week  before the baby is due   • are still employed by the same   employer when the baby is born  • earn at least £95 per week on   average (before tax) in the eight  weeks immediately before the  week your baby is born.  How much is it? £123.06 per week or 90% of your  partner’s average weekly earnings,  whichever is less.  How do I claim? Your partner must give their  employer at least 28 days’ notice of  the date when they want their SPP  to start – or notify them as soon   as is reasonably practicable.  17  I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  171  More information Visit www.direct.gov.uk/ workandfamilies   Time off for  dependants Every employee is also entitled to  emergency unpaid leave to make  arrangements for the care of a  child who falls ill, gives birth or is  injured. This leave can be used if  there is a sudden problem with  care arrangements for your   child – for example, if your  childminder falls ill.  Flexible working  arrangements Parents have the right to   ask for ﬂexible working  arrangements. If you need to  change your working hours  because of childcare, you also  have the right to have your  request considered seriously  under sex discrimination law.  Follow the procedure outlined  on page 173. If your request is  refused, you should get advice  about whether you have a claim  for compensation under the   new right and under sex  discrimination law.  Your rights You have the right to request  ﬂexible working arrangements  if you have or expect to have  parental responsibility for:  • a child under 17   (from April 2009), or   • a disabled child under 18 who   is entitled to Disability Living  Allowance (DLA).  Parental responsibility means   that you are a:  • mother • father • adopter • guardian  Parental leave Parental leave is designed to give  parents more time with their young  children. It entitles you to take   13 weeks’ leave per parent per child,  usually unpaid, up to your child’s ﬁfth  birthday. Parents of disabled children  are entitled to 18 weeks’ leave, to  be taken before the child is 18. For  parental leave, a disabled child is  a child who gets Disability Living  Allowance (DLA). It is also available  for adoptive parents, in which case  you can take it either within ﬁve  years of the placement for adoption  or before your child’s 18th birthday,  whichever is earlier.   Who gets it? Employees who have been employed  for a year by the time they wish to  take leave to care for a child.  You cannot usually take all your   13 weeks in one go. Your employer  may limit the amount of leave you  can take to four weeks per child in  any one year.  How do I claim? You must give your employer   21 days’ notice of the dates  when you want to take your  leave. Your employer can  postpone the leave, but only  if their business would be  disrupted unduly.   Fathers wanting to take  Fathers wanting to take  Fathers wanting to take  Fathers wanting to take  time off at or around  time off at or around  time off at or around  the birth of their baby  the birth of their baby  the birth of their baby  can take parental leave,  can take parental leave,  can take parental leave,  providing they give  providing they give  providing they give  their employers 21 days’  their employers 21 days’  their employers 21 days’  notice of the expected  notice of the expected  notice of the expected  week of childbirth.   week of childbirth.  week of childbirth.

Flexible working  Flexible working covers a wide  variety of working practices.  It can be any working pattern  other than the normal working  pattern in an organisation.   Most people are familiar with  working part time for pro-rata  pay or working different shift  patterns. Other ways of ﬂexible  working include the following:  •	Flexitime. Employees may be  required to work within core  hours, but outside these times  they get ﬂexibility in how they  work their hours.   • Job sharing. Typically,   two employees share the  work normally done by one  employee.   •	Working from home.   New technology makes work  possible by telephone, fax and  email from home, or other  remote locations.   •	Term-time working. An  employee on a permanent  contract takes paid or unpaid  leave during school holidays.   •	Staggered hours. Employees   in the same workplace have  different start, ﬁnish and  break times – often as a way of  covering longer opening hours.  •	Compressed working hours.   Employees work their total  agreed hours over fewer  working days – for example,  a ﬁve-day working week is  compressed into four days.   There is a clear procedure that  you and your employer must  follow. Your employer must  seriously consider your request  and can only refuse for one of  the business reasons set out in  the legislation. Any reduction in  the number of hours worked will  result in pay being reduced.  172  • special guardian • foster parent • private foster carer, or • person who has been granted   a residence order in respect   of a child  or  • you are married to, or the  partner or civil partner of,   one of the above.  The change that you ask for can  relate to the hours that you   work, the days that you work   or your place of work.   Who does it apply to?  You can ask for ﬂexible working if:   • you are an employee • you have worked for your   employer for 26 continuous  weeks prior to your request  (continuous employment generally  means working for the same  employer without a break,   but this is not always the case.  Further information is available   at www.direct.gov.uk  • you have parental responsibility  for a child under 17 (from April  2009) or a disabled child under 18  who is entitled to DLA (or you are  married to, or the partner or civil  partner of, that person).  You cannot ask for ﬂexible   working if:  • you have made a request in the   last 12 months  last 12 months   • you are an agency worker • you are a member of the   armed forces.  How do I ask to change   my hours? Your request/application must:   • be in writing (whether on paper   or by email). Find out if your  employer has a standard form  for making an application. If not,  sample letters can be downloaded  from www.direct.gov.uk   • state that the application is being  made under the statutory right to  request a ﬂexible working pattern  • conﬁrm that you are applying as  someone who has or expects to  have parental responsibility for the  upbringing of a child under 17 or  a disabled child under 18 who is  entitled to DLA and that you are  the parent, adopter, guardian or  foster parent of the child (or that  you are married to, or the partner   or civil partner of, that person)   • state the ﬂexible working pattern   you are asking for and the date  you want it to start. The proposed  date should allow time for the  application to be considered and  implemented.

When your employer   receives the application Your employer must:   17  • hold a meeting with you within   28 days of your application.   You are allowed to bring a  companion but your employer  does not have to let you bring  someone who is not employed   by them. This meeting should  discuss your application. If your  employer does not think that   the proposed working pattern   can be accommodated within   the needs of the business,   they should discuss any possible  compromise arrangements  • give you notice of their decision  within 14 days of the meeting   and tell you about your right   of appeal  • give a reason for refusing, which   must be one of those allowed  by the regulations, with an  explanation of why that reason  applies in your case.   Refusing your request Your employer can only refuse your  request for one of the following  business reasons:   • the burden of additional costs • the detrimental effect on the   ability to meet customer demand  • an inability to reorganise the   work among existing staff  • an inability to recruit   additional staff  • the detrimental effect on quality • the detrimental effect on   performance  • not enough work during the  periods when the employee   wants to work  • planned structural changes.  Your employer must also explain  why that reason applies in your  circumstances.   I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I        T S  173  Legal help  The legal help scheme allows  people on a low income to get free  legal advice and assistance when  preparing for a tribunal. Funding for  general legal advice (not advocacy)  is available, to those who qualify  ﬁnancially, under the legal help  scheme. Full representation is  available under legal aid (to those  who qualify ﬁnancially) for cases  brought in the Employment   Appeal Tribunal.  More information is available at  www.adviceguide.org.uk  YOUR RIGHTS  UNDER SEX  DISCRIMINATION  LAW It may be indirect sex discrimination  if an employer refuses a woman’s  request to change her working  pattern. It may be direct sex  discrimination if an employer refuses  a man’s request when they allow a  woman to work differently.  Your employer will only know  if they have a good reason for  refusing your request if they give it  a lot of thought. Refusing even to  consider your request or having a  policy of refusing part-time work  could be seen as sex discrimination  by an employment tribunal. An  employer must consider each  individual request in order to avoid  discriminating against a woman or   a man with childcare responsibilities.   People often assume that a job has  to be done full time or at certain  ﬁxed times of day, but if you and  your employer look carefully at  your job you may be able to work  out a more child-friendly option –  perhaps one that neither of you had  considered before.   Who does the law apply to? Sex discrimination law applies to all  employers and all employed parents  with childcare responsibilities.  It only applies if you would be  disadvantaged by not being allowed  to work the child-friendly hours you  need. You must have a good reason  for asking to work differently – just  as an employer must have a good  reason for refusing. A good reason  might be:   • you cannot ﬁnd or afford full-time   childcare   • you cannot ﬁnd or afford childcare  outside 9am–5pm, Monday–Friday  • you have to be there when your   child or children come home   from school  • your parents or relatives cannot   look after your child full time • you are suffering from severe  stress from working long hours  • you are distressed or   disadvantaged by having to work  your old hours.   The difference between  rights under sex  discrimination law and the  right to request ﬂexible  working The new statutory right to request  ﬂexible working only applies to  employees who are parents of  children under 17 (or under 18   if disabled), who have not made   an application within the last   12 months, and who have worked  for their employer for 26 weeks at  the time of making the application.   Sex discrimination law may help you  if you need to change your working  pattern in order to care for your  child but cannot use the statutory  procedure. This may be because  you have made a request under the  procedure within the last 12 months  or have worked for your employer  for less than 26 weeks.   Appeal You have the right to appeal within  14 days of receiving notiﬁcation of  your employer’s refusal. To appeal,  you must write to your employer  stating your reasons for appealing.  You must sign and date your letter.  Your employer must hold the appeal  meeting within 14 days of receiving  your notice of appeal. You have  the right to be accompanied during  the meeting if you wish, usually  by another worker employed by  the same employer, although your  employer may agree to let someone  else attend. Your employer must:   • allow your companion time off   to accompany you without it  affecting their pay  • hold the meeting at a convenient   time and place for both parties, and  • notify you of their decision in  writing within 14 days of the  appeal meeting, giving reasons   for their decision.   Tribunals You can make a claim in a tribunal   if your employer does not follow the  procedure or refuses for a reason  not stated in the rules or without   an explanation.  You must complete the appeal  procedure and wait for the   decision before you can make   a tribunal application.   An employment tribunal or an Acas  binding arbitration that ﬁnds in your  favour can order your employer to:  • reconsider your application by   following the procedure correctly  • pay you an award (up to a   maximum of eight weeks’ pay  (up to the statutory maximum of  £350 per week) in compensation).  174  The procedure  There is no speciﬁc application  procedure under sex discrimination  law. If you can, initially make your  request under the new right to ask  for ﬂexible working (see page 172).  If your employer refuses   your request If your new working pattern  will cause major problems, then  your employer may be justiﬁed  in refusing your request. You can  get further advice from your trade  union representative or local Citizens   Advice Bureau or the Equality and  Human Rights Commission (EHRC).   If you want advice on whether  you might have a good case for a  tribunal, you should see a specialist  employment lawyer.   If this doesn’t work, you can make   a claim in an employment tribunal   if your employer refuses your  request without a good business  reason. The tribunal will look at your  reason. The tribunal will look at your  employer’s reasons and will question  employer’s reasons and will question  them carefully about whether  them carefully about whether  they were justiﬁed in refusing  they were justiﬁed in refusing   your request. They can also award  unlimited compensation for loss of  pay (if you had to leave your job)  and for injury to feelings.   You must make a tribunal claim  within three months of the refusal  under the new right and under sex  discrimination law.  Have you claimed everything?  You can claim  Child  Beneﬁt  Free  prescriptions  Free dental  treatment  If you get  Income-based  JSA  Income  Support  Low  income  All  mothers  £500   Sure Start  Maternity  Grant*  Social  Fund  loans***  Council  Tax  Beneﬁt  (not NI and  Housing  Beneﬁt)  Help with  mortgage  Healthy  Start**  Fares to  hospital  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  *****  Y  *****  Y  *  Y  ****  Y  ****  N  Y  Y  N  N  Y  Y  Y  N  Y  Y  N  N  Y  Y  N  N  Y  Y  Y  N  *   **   ***    You can claim if you get Pension Credit, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Working Tax Credit, where a  disability or severe disability element is included in the award or Child Tax Credit at a rate higher than the family element.

The qualifying  criteria for Healthy Start are: Income Support /income-based JSA/income-related Employment and Support Allowance/Child  Tax Credit without Working Tax Credit (unless Working Tax Credit run-on only is in payment) and annual family income of  £16,040 or less.   You have to be on Income Support, income-based JSA, income-related Employment and Support Allowance or Pension  Credit to get a Social Fund loan (called a Budgeting Loan) unless there is an emergency or disaster and you are without  resources to prevent risk to health (this is called a Crisis Loan).  Free prescriptions and free dental are only available for low income/all mothers during pregnancy and for one year after birth.  ****  *****  Some people will get full help, other people may only get partial help – it all depends on how low income is.  17     I  R G H T S A N D B E N E F I     T S  175  THE NHS   CONSTITUTION  The NHS belongs to us all. It touches our lives at times of basic human need,   when care and compassion are what matter most. Pregnancy is one of these times.   So it is important that you know what you and your baby can expect from the  NHS, and what is expected from you in return.  The NHS Constitution was launched on 21 January  2009. It brings together for the ﬁrst time in one place  what staff, patients and the public can expect from  the NHS. It explains that by working together we  can make the very best of ﬁnite resources to improve  our health and well-being, to keep our minds and  bodies well, to get better when we are ill, and when   we cannot recover to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives. The  Constitution reafﬁrms that everyone has a role to play in the success of   the NHS.  As well as capturing what is important to the NHS (the principles and  values that determine how the NHS should act and make decisions), the  Constitution brings together a number of rights, pledges and responsibilities  for staff and patients alike.    These rights, pledges and responsibilities are the result of extensive  discussion and research with staff, patients and the public and they reﬂect  what matters to them most.    Rights The NHS Constitution sets out the legal rights of the public, patients   and staff. Some of the rights that may be of interest to you are listed below:  • You have the right to receive NHS services free of charge, unless   Parliament has sanctioned charges.  • You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. • You have the right to be treated with a professional standard of care. • You have the right to be given information about your care. • You have the right to privacy and conﬁdentiality. • You have the right to be involved in discussions and decisions   about your care.  • You have the right to have any complaints you make properly   investigated.  176  Pledges The NHS Constitution sets out a number of pledges for the public, patients  and staff. These are things that the NHS is committed to achieving. Some  of the pledges that may be of interest to you are listed below:  • The NHS commits to make sure that it is easy to access health services. • The NHS commits to inform you about the services that are available   to you.  • The NHS commits to offer you information that helps you to take part   in making decisions about your care.  • The NHS commits to work in partnership with you, your family, carers   and representatives.  •  The NHS commits to treat you with courtesy and to be supportive    when you make a complaint.  Responsibilities There are a number of things we can all do to help the NHS deliver   quality services. These are set out as responsibilities in the NHS Constitution.  Responsibilities are the things we can all do to help the NHS work  effectively. You should always think about your responsibilities when you  are receiving NHS services. You have nine responsibilities to keep in mind:  • Do what you can yourself to stay healthy and feel well. • Register with a GP. • Treat NHS staff and patients with respect. • Give accurate information about yourself. • Keep appointments, or let the NHS know when you cannot keep them. • Follow the course of your treatment, or speak to someone if you feel   you cannot.  • Take part in important public health immunisation programmes. • Make sure people close to you know about your wishes for organ donation. • Give feedback on your treatment and care.  The NHS Constitution sets out all of these rights and pledges, together with  the principles and values, in more detail. The NHS Constitution Handbook  contains further information.  Want to know more? The NHS Constitution  Handbook gives further  information about the NHS  Constitution and further  advice on what to do if   you are not happy with   the service you receive.

It can be a sign of an infection  or pre-eclampsia. Your midwife will test your urine for albumin at your antenatal check-ups.   A test in which a thin needle is inserted into the uterus through the abdominal wall to take a  sample of the ﬂuid surrounding the baby. The ﬂuid is then tested for certain chromosomal and  genetic disorders. An amniocentesis is usually carried out between 15 and 18 weeks into your  pregnancy. It may be used later in pregnancy to ﬁnd out if your baby’s lungs are mature.  Amniotic sac  The bag of ﬂuid that surrounds and cushions your baby in the uterus. Before or during labour  the sac breaks and the ﬂuid drains out. This is called the ‘waters breaking’.  Anaesthetics  Medicines that reduce or take away pain.

Morning sickness affects more than half of all pregnant women. Symptoms include nausea   or feeling sick, as well as actually being sick. Morning sickness can occur at any time of the day,  though it occurs most often in the morning because blood sugar levels are low after a night  without food. The symptoms usually start after the ﬁrst month of the pregnancy, peaking in  weeks ﬁve to seven, and continuing until weeks 14 to 16.   Neonatal care  The care given to sick or premature babies. It takes place in a neonatal unit, which is specially  designed and equipped to care for them.  Nuchal  translucency scan  An ultrasound scan to help identify whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down’s syndrome.

Babies at risk of Down’s syndrome  tend to have a higher amount of ﬂuid around their neck. The scan may also help conﬁrm both the  accuracy of the pregnancy dates and whether the baby has any other health problems.  Obstetric  cholestasis  Obstetrician  Oedema  Ovulation  Paediatrician  Perinatal   A potentially dangerous liver disorder. Symptoms include severe generalised itching without   a rash, particularly in the last four months of pregnancy.  A doctor specialising in the care of women during pregnancy and labour and after the birth.  Another word for swelling, most often of the feet and hands. It is usually nothing to worry about,  but if it gets worse suddenly it can be a sign of pre-eclampsia.  Ovulation occurs when an egg (ovum) is released from one of a woman’s ovaries during   her monthly menstrual cycle. If the egg is fertilised during this time, she will get pregnant.   This is the time of the month when you are most likely to conceive.   A doctor specialising in the care of babies and children.

The organ attached to the lining of the uterus, which separates your baby’s circulation from   your circulation. Oxygen and food from your bloodstream are passed to your baby’s bloodstream  through the placenta and along the umbilical cord. Waste is also removed this way.   The period beginning immediately after the birth of a baby until they are about six   weeks old.  The professional care provided to you and your baby, from the birth until your baby is   about six to eight weeks old. It usually involves home visits by midwives to check that both  mother and baby are well. Classes may also be available.  Feelings of depression and hopelessness after the birth of a baby. These feelings are more  severe than the ‘baby blues’ (see page 178). Postnatal depression affects one in 10 women and  can be serious if left untreated. See page 82 for more information.   A condition that only occurs during pregnancy. Symptoms include high blood pressure,   protein in urine, bad headaches, vision problems and the sudden swelling of the face,   hands and feet. It usually develops after the 20th week of pregnancy but can occur earlier.   Although most cases are mild and cause no trouble, it can be serious for both mother   and baby. For more information, see page 67.     G L O S S A R Y O F   U S E F U L    T E R M S  Premature birth  The birth of a baby before the standard period of pregnancy (37 weeks) is completed.   Premature labour  When labour starts before 37 weeks of pregnancy.  Rhesus disease  A woman who is rhesus negative (see below) can carry a baby who is rhesus positive if the  baby’s father is rhesus positive. This can cause problems in second or later pregnancies. If she  gets pregnant with another rhesus positive baby, the immune response will be quicker and  much greater. The antibodies produced by the mother can cross the placenta and attach to the  D antigen on her baby’s red blood cells. This can be harmful to the baby as it may result in a  condition called haemolytic disease of the newborn, which can lead to anaemia and jaundice.  Rhesus negative  People with a certain blood type are known as rhesus negative. It means that they do not  have a substance known as D antigen on the surface of their red blood cells. This can cause  problems in second or later pregnancies (see above).  Rhesus positive  People with a certain blood type are known as rhesus positive. This means that they have   a substance known as D antigen on the surface of their red blood cells.   Rubella (German  measles)  Ultrasound/scans  A virus that can seriously affect unborn babies if the mother gets it during the early weeks   of pregnancy. Most women have been immunised against rubella, so they are not at risk.  An imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your baby  in the uterus. It shows your baby’s body and organs as well as the surrounding tissues. Also  called sonography, this test is widely used to estimate delivery dates and check that   your developing baby is healthy and growing normally.  Umbilical cord  The cord that attaches the baby to the placenta, linking the baby and mother. Blood circulates  through the cord, carrying oxygen and food to the baby and carrying waste away again.  Vernix  Vertebrae  A sticky white coating that covers a baby when it is in the uterus. It mostly disappears   before birth but there may be some left on your baby when they are born.  Your spine is made up of 33 irregularly shaped bones called vertebrae. Each vertebra has   a hole in the middle through which the spinal cord runs.  181  USEFUL ORGANISATIONS    INFORMATION  Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and  Arbitration Service) 23rd ﬂoor Euston Tower 286 Euston Road London NW1 3JJ 08457 47 47 47 (helpline, Mon–Fri 8am–8pm;  Sat 9am–1pm) www.acas.org.uk Improves organisations and working life through  better employment relations.
