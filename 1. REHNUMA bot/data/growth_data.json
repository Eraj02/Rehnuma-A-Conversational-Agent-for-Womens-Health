Your egg is fertilized 12 to 24 hours later if a sperm penetrates it - and this simple biological occurrence begins a series of increasingly complicated processes that leads to a new human life, if all goes well. Over the next several days, the fertilized egg will start dividing into multiple cells as it travels down the fallopian tube, enters your uterus, and starts to burrow into the uterine lining."
